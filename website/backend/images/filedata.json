        "description": "In Wanderlust, you are racing through an arrow maze, trying to pick up the right Things and take those Things where you can win with them. The playing area consists of a 6x7 grid of double-sided tiles. On one face, the tiles display the possible moves and on the other, places for winning and actions available to the players. After having done the action or move shown on a tile, the player flips the tile over. Like Fluxx, the Goals are indefinite, but unlike Fluxx, Wanderlust requires much more turn-by-turn planning. Complete rules, example turns, and PDFs are available at: http://ceruleansgames.tripod.com/wanderlust.htm",

Situated probably atop Mont Auxois, above modern Alise-Sainte-Reine in France, but this location does not fit Caesar's description of the battle. A number of alternatives have been proposed over time, among which Chaux-des-Crotenay (in Jura in modern France) only remains as challenger today. This battle was fought by the army of the Roman Republic commanded by Julius Caesar, aided by cavalry commanders Mark Antony, Titus Labienus and Gaius Trebonius, against a confederation of Gallic tribes united under the leadership of Vercingetorix of the Averni. Alesia was the last major engagement between Gauls and Romans, and marked the turning point of the Gallic Wars in favour of Rome. The siege of Alesia is considered one of Caesar's greatest military achievements, and is still one of the classic examples of siege warfare and circumvallation. Now, in this game free to download and play, as Caesar, You will defend a system of ramparts, forts and awesome fortifications with units representing legion cohorts, leaders, archers, Germanic cavalry and, as Vergingetorix, you will assault the Roman besiegers with infantry and cavalry units from 46 Gallic tribes. The game system comes from the Ancients freeware game with some modifications.",

Players start as bondsman and attempt to ascent ranks, with the goal to obtain ministry positions at the court of the kaiser. Each ministry equals one vote. The objective of the game is to gain enough votes to assign the new emperor after the old kaiser died. By managing workers, building new buildings, trading with cities, raising taxes, diplomacy and using political influence, cultural development, population growth, and military actions, each player tries to reach specific conditions which qualify him/her for either secular or religious ascension. Moreover, each player has to guarantee the continuous existence of her/his dynasty by getting offspring and marrying offspring with the offspring of other players. In each round, every player plans ahead 5 actions which, in most of the cases, can be played simultaneously. Seven different kinds of actions are possible (diplomacy/intrigue; get influence cards; income/trading; build; development; expansion; action upgrade), each of which can be improved up to five levels (except for \"action upgrade\"). The population size determines the number of workers a player commands. Workers are necessary for military expansion, operating buildings, trading with cities etc.",

You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play. Tiles is an abstract card game for two or three players.  Players play tiles to try to close areas of their colour to score points.  The larger the closed area, the more points scored.  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. There are 45 square tiles, each subdivided into four triangular areas which are either white, black or gray.  Each player is assigned a colour.  Tiles must be played so the edge colours match already-played tiles; if one cannot play any tile, one must discard instead.  You can score only on your own turn.",

The galaxy is randomized at the beginning of each game, so no two games are the same ! And you will constantly try to outthink your opponent (in a fun way, in our experience :) ) The game length is about 45-90 minutes (depends on the players). In the gameplay Galaxy of D uses almost no dice/randomizer of any kind, I think this is a very Euro game. Bad moves, and the game can end in 15-30 minutes! 1. INTRODUCTION Once again, the Redog (red) and the Cynder (blue) come face to face to conquer a galaxy\u2026the Galaxy of D !! You are a space war commander who controls a small fleet of ships on the Redog/Cynder side. You spend money to buy ships, then you can move ships around to attack other ships and enemy Starbases. Also, you can take control of planets and asteroids by moving your ships to their sectors. Holding planets and asteroids is important because this gives you a steady income that can be used to buy more ships, but keep in mind that your enemy is going to be competing with you for those same resources. If you move a Freighter to a planet, it automatically acquires cargo. Once a Freighter has cargo, you can sell it to the Spaceport. Each Freighter can carry one cargo and only Freighters can carry cargo. Just watch out for those pirates! One last thing. In an act of sabotage, someone turned on your Starbase\u2019s self-destruct mechanism. This means that it will gradually destroy itself, assuming that your enemies don\u2019t eliminate you first. Really, you have no time to waste. Get to it, commander! 2. THE MISSION Your goal is to eliminate your enemy\u2019s Starbase while protecting your own. Home Page: http://www.hullahop.biz/jackd",

        "description": "Welcome to Pellinoria , land of knights and dragons, jesters and jousts, gold and chivalry. The king will reward the chivalrous, while the queen favours the wealthy. Great fame and glory will be bestowed on those who manage to defeat one of the many dragons that prowl the land, but they will not be able to do so without the aid of a knight. Those seeking a gentler path may make a deal with the merchant, court the princess or gain a small favour from the jester. And the belligerent will seek to harm their opponents by banding with the black knight or by persuading a thief to perform his nefarious deeds. Can you become chief noble by the end of your time in Pellinoria ? The game is played over 4 years of 4 seasons each. Before each year, the cards are laid out so that each corresponds to a number. Then, during each season, the players roll their dice, assign pairs of them to cards that match the value rolled and take the relevant actions. At the end of the game, the player with most victory points is the winner.",

        "description": "In a post-apocalypse future (\u00e0 la Mad Max), with scarce resources and few individuals, the survivor clans resolve disputes through ritualised racing instead of open warfare. You are one of these mad drivers. Only the first place counts, and no holds are barred. The print-yourself components include 10 two-sided race track segments, six player cars and control panels (with tokens for shift gear and engine temperature), a 54 card deck (of additional car equipment) and armour, tires, brakes and turbo tokens. Five dice are also needed. On your turn, you can speed up, slow down or change gears. This is cleverly handled by the control panel, where speed is vertical and gears horizontal - but not all grid points are connected. You can only go so fast in first gear! The gear diagram is also colour-coded to indicate how bad the engine heat test is. In addition, you may spend brake or turbo tokens (to slow down or speed up further). You manoeuvre your car from lane to lane - but this depends on speed and your driving skill test. The faster you go, the less you can switch lanes. Tire tokens are spent for extra lane changes. If you ram an obstacle or another player, armour tokens are spent. Other cars could end up being pushed. A favourite technique is the Rush N' Crush, where you speed up right behind your opponent so as to crush him forcefully.",

The game incorporates elements of resource management and seasonality to generate variety. The wide variety of beer styles ensures that no two games are the same. Recipe Cards show the combination of Ingredients needed to produce it - and the resulting number of Pints awarded. Recipe cards are always played face up. Brewery cards allow you to purchase Ingredients needed for Recipes. Action Cards affect the fortunes of other brewers in the game. Ingredients include Base Malts, Specialty Malts, and Hops as the standard Ingredients that make up most beer Recipes. There is an element of chance required to obtain Special Ingredients such as bacteria, spices, rice, and oats. Each round the season advances. Brewers with seasonal beers on tap get additional Ingredients to make new Recipes. Brewers earn Pints from recipes (between one and five pints) and some brewery cards. The number of Pints needed to win the game depends on the number of brewers.",

Each turn, players draw a new hand of illnesses and try to match sets of them to specialists and physicians, each of whom will treat a different sort of set. After all specialists have seen a patient, or a player manages to cure their entire hand, a round ends and players earn points for illnesses left uncured in their hands. At the end of several rounds, the player with the lowest number of points is the least sick, and therefore the winner!",

Starting in the lowly fourth division, sign new players, train up those you have, sell the dead weight, increase the size of your stadium, get new sponsors, hire and fire staff and cry as injury strikes your squad at the worst possible moment. Finally pick your team, your formation and take on 31 other unique teams with their own strengths and weaknesses. Win and the world is yours. Lose and glory starts to look a long way away. Footy Manager can be played solo or multiplayer with friends. All you need are the files, rules, a pencil, eraser and a couple of six sided dice! Unique mechanisms make every play-through different as players retire, start or stop improving, get injured, request transfers and more. If you've got a long trip, a quiet evening in or some time to kill on a commute then just print off the sheets and get playing!",

        "description": "The Company has colonised the planet LV-426 . Contact with the \"Shake and bake\" colony is lost. The Company sends a team of Colonial Marines, with Ripley as \"Advisor\", to find out what has happened at Hadley's Hope. Aliens: This Time it's War is an unauthorised, non-profit and non-collectable card game set within the boundaries of the hugely influential 1986 sci-fi film, Aliens . Consisting of two balanced 60-card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of the Colonial Marines, and his opponent assumes control of the hordes of deadly xenomorphs. At their disposal, the Colonial Marines - very tough hombres - have a roster of high-tech, state-of-the-art weaponry. The Alien player's objective is to eliminate all the Marines, before they escape the planet and \"Nuke the entire site from orbit.\" The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Aliens: This Time it's War is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive melees. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with Marines butchered frequently, and aliens destroyed by the well-placed use of cards. Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colonial Marine player could choose to deploy the Powerloader during the Reactor Chamber battle, but the resources that this would require make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Alien player can deploy the Alien Queen at any time during the conflict - she's free to play aboard the Sulaco , but hugely expensive if used during the APC Withdrawal, for instance. Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. No icons are used. Aliens: This Time it's War can trace its parentage back to San Juan , Magic: The Gathering , Battle Line , BattleTech CCG , and Iliad . Victory Conditions: The Colonial Marine player wins if she manages to \"Nuke the entire site from orbit\". The Colonial Marine player wins if she reaches and survives the Sulaco Loading Bay battle. The Alien player wins if Ripley and all the Colonial Marines are either killed or cocooned.",

Akzinal - Brilliant thieves on a race against time to rescue a world from implosion. Felian - A brutal race hell-bent to control the galaxy. Homin - An evil force has destroyed the home world of Erychosia. Can they find the key to time travel and stop the disaster before it happens? Morph - Shape-shifting people seeking to develop their civilization through technology. Ralyk - Fighting \"the madness\", a terminal disease, the Ralyk try to improve their genetic codes and overcome the disease by stealing genes from other species. Varpor - Fed up with the wars, kidnappings, thieveries and utter violence that has overtaken the galaxy, the Varpor, and their liveship Sunrays take it upon themselves to police the galaxy and restore order. Wallaboo also make an appearance in the form of a powerful ally. Aside from missions, Ethereum adds worlds into play. Trading is introduced as a playing mechanic, and civilizations develop by developing technologies that will help each to fulfill their story. Each world has a unique power, and when the powers collide, the battles are certain to be epic. This is, at this time, a print and play game. The rule set, all cards and sheets are provided on this site for your printing and reference.Again, the rules are quite simple, and play should begin perhaps less than 10 minutes after resources have been printed. Though cubes can be purchased for easier game play, scratch paper works as well. This is NOT an expansion. This is a completely new game with the same incredible characters. This might be compared to a much easier way of learning a thematic game like Twilight Imperium or Galactic Emperor. And thank you Christian Peterson and Adam West for your incredible contributions toward playing mechanics and story-based game play.",

For nearly 10 years, the troops that remained loyal to the Empire of Brazil fought epic battles against those of the new Republic! \"Farrapos\" is a board game for 2 players created by Julio Trois, which has the theme of the Farroupilha Revolution. During 11 rounds each army will win the largest number of cities, adding up the maximum points possible. \"Farrapos\" is a tactical game, where military strategy is very important. Each player must organize his troops, composed of tiles of infantry, cavalry and artillery. The clashes follow the style of the best wargames, using dice and tables, for the resolution of battles.",

        "description": "Tee up for the opening drive! Pocket Pro Golf\u2122 brings you the best aspects of real golf--club selection, careful aim, and shot consideration--in a pocket sized game that will fit in any golf bag. One to four players can play anywhere from a single hole to a full round of 18 holes. Unlike many other golf games, Pocket Pro Golf\u2122 shows you the \"narrative\" of each shot as it works its way down the fairway. Watch as your ball comes perilously close to each hazard. Did you plan the shot well enough to keep your ball on course? Each hole is created using a series of modular game cards. Hazards and features can be set up at random or arranged to resemble any hole from any golf course in the world. Once the hole is assembled, players must choose the right club, aim carefully (taking wind into account) and hit the ball with the right swing tempo. Too fast and you'll lose control of the ball. Too slow and your ball won't go far enough. The core of the game uses a clever movement mechanic that combines loss of control with distance. You use a number of dice to represent swing tempo (one two or three for slow, moderate and fast). Doubles and triples represent the effects of wind and slope, causing your ball to make semi-random deviations from a straight shot. Roll more dice and you're more likely to lose control and have your ball drift off course!",

Each Paranoid must struggle with his own weakening grasp on sanity to reveal the Groups, Methods and Goals used by the other players' Enemies. Meanwhile, the Enemies do their best to mislead the Paranoids, betray their competing plotters to them, or just drive them insane (for purposes of entertainment only, though some people do take their games much too seriously). There are two ways to win the game, and part of a winning strategy is attacking yourself! This game was one of the entries in the 2006 Microgame Design Contest.

They're placed to the side and their total is noted.  In clockwise order, players place bets as to whether their roll will be higher or lower than the first roll.  Maximum bet is the number of players in the current round.  Minimum bet is 1.  Then in clockwise order the players roll the die again.  If their total is higher than the original noted roll they take the \"High\" bets.  If their total is lower than the original noted role they take the \"Low\" bets.  On a roll that matches the original noted roll they take both piles. When players tie for high and low they must split evenly leaving the remainder in the betting pools.  If a player or players roll a match then no \"High\" or \"Low\" players win and all bets are divided equally among winners leaving remainders in their original betting pools.",

The pieces are cubes with kanji in red for 'samurai' and kanji in black for 'sword' on each face. The playing field starts empty. Each player receives one Samurai and, beginning with Black, drops them onto their respective cells in turn. Such placement must be so that the upward face of the cube does NOT present a 'sword' kanji toward the opponent. Movement consists of either rotating the cube one face clockwise, rolling it forward one face toward the opponent, rolling it    left one face or rolling it right one face. The upward face of each cube controls the play of the game. If an opponent cube presents an upward face which has a forward 'sword' and the upward face of the player's cube does NOT present a forward 'sword', the player must rotate only. If an opponent cube presents a 'sword' forward, and the player presents a 'sword' forward, the player must roll the cube directly away from the 'samurai' kanji on its upward face. The game is won by the player who is able to present an upward face with a forward 'sword' and a rearward 'samurai' when the opponent cube also presents a forward 'sword' with a rearward 'samurai'. The 'samurai' are considered to be facing each other with their 'swords' met.",

Each fighter is made of four dice: head, body, legs, and weapon and a unique special ability card.  Combat involves rolling damage and hit location dice.  As fighters take damage, rotate their body parts to show the remaining hit points until finally destroyed. In addition to the standard attack, players can choose to change weapons, perform first aid, disarm an opponent, or make called shots for increased damage. Be the last fighter standing to win the game! Chunky Fighters was nominated for the Golden Geek Best Print and Play Game two years in a row! The original Chunky Fighters won second place in the print-and-play dice game contest: Print-and-Play Contest  -- Closed! But come look at what people made!",

        "description": "We are in Mecca , the holiest Islamic city in Saudi Arabia and prophet Muhammad's birthplace. Year after year, Mecca receives more than a three million faithful on one of their faith's pillars: the Holy Pilgrimage or Hajj. We are going to access the inside of the Holy Mosque of Mecca right now, the main shrine of Muslim pilgrimage during the Hajj... the imposing Sacred Kaaba is just in front of us... In order to avoid crowds during the massive influx of the faithful in the Holy Mosque the organizers have devised an innovative system to control the placement and organization of the pilgrims during their prayers to Allah. The player who successfully introduces more pilgrims in the Holy Place according to this organization system will be the winner. Game contents: - 1 Game Board. - 108 Pilgrims/counters (in 6 colors: yellow, red, green, blue, black and white): 18 for each player. - 1 Rule Book. La Meca es la principal ciudad de la regi\u00f3n del Hiyaz, en la actual Arabia Saudita, y una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la pen\u00ednsula de Arabia. Para los musulmanes, el peregrinaje a La Meca forma parte de uno de los aspectos fundamentales de su fe, los denominados pilares del Islam. Cada a\u00f1o, cerca de tres millones de peregrinos se dirigen a la Ciudad Santa para realizar el peregrinaje mayor o Hajj durante el mes musulm\u00e1n de du l-hiyya. Muchos m\u00e1s hacen la peregrinaci\u00f3n menor o Umrah, que puede realizarse durante todo el a\u00f1o. Muy pocos no musulmanes han podido ver los ritos y rituales del Hajj, ya que est\u00e1 totalmente prohibida la entrada de no creyentes en La Meca . Con el fin de que no se produzcan aglomeraciones durante el Hajj, en la Mezquita Sagrada han ideado un sistema de colocaci\u00f3n y reorganizaci\u00f3n para controlar a los peregrinos. El jugador que consiga introducir m\u00e1s peregrinos en el recinto sagrado ser\u00e1 el ganador. Contenido del juego: - 1 Tablero de juego. - 108 Peregrinos/fichas (en 6 colores: amarillo, rojo, verde, azul, negro y blanco): 18 para cada jugador. - 1 Reglamento de juego.",

Players proceed to struggle for influence in the unindustrialized regions of the world, and the subsequent resources such influence entails. Each turn is divided into action phases and colonization phases. During action phases, players use cards to secretly bid influence in the six regions of the game board. During colonization phases, all cards in play are revealed, the placement of influence is resolved, and conflict occurs. Whenever all native influence is eliminated from a region, that region's resources are collected. The amount of resources collected by each player depends on each players' influence in the region. At the end of the game, the player who collects the most resources wins.",

The trick is: whenever you get control over a hexagon, you lose some of the pawns that made you win. Players take turns placing a pawn on the board. You must discover how to win while losing as few pawns as possible, or \"help\" your opponent to win and have him lose as many pawns as possible.",

Each scenario adds a different twist to the Basic Rules, such as ways to avoid obstacles, movement variations and additional traps. Charts are available in two ways, as downloadable PDFs, purchased at the site, or in pre-printed booklets, which can be ordered at the site or purchased at local brick-and-mortar stores. All that is needed to play is a chart for each player and a pen or pencil. The game is kind of a miniature dungeon crawl, with each player serving as the others' GM. (It also has been compared to Battleship, in that each player hides obstacles from the other.) Visit www.ghoulash.com for the rules, strategy tips, promotional apparel and more info.",

Space Marvels 6 Express (SM6e) is a PnP Express tile laying game for 2 to 5 players in the vein of 7 Wonders playable in 15-20 minutes. Players begin by each choosing a different Marvel Board, divided into 3 different sections, or Ages of exploration. Each board gives the player an initial resource. Players are also given 3 credits to start the game. Players are then dealt a hand of tiles (8 tiles 2-3 players, 6 tiles for 4-5 players) and may do one of three things during each phase of a round: a. Play a tile if they can pay the cost in resources, gaining future benefits, resources, and other bonuses b. Use the tile face down + pay resources to build a section of their Marvel (thereby gaining bonus abilities) c. Discard the tile for 3 credits Players may play their tiles simultaneously and may buy resources from neighboring players at a cost of 2 credits. After each player has played a tile, all players pass their remaining tiles to the player next to them. The rounds end when all tiles dealt have been played. A VP scoring round them occurs comparing Military strengths of each player. VP is awarded and a new round begins with the next set of tiles. After 3 rounds of play, groups of tiles are scored for VP based upon Organizations built as well as credits earned and final Military strengths of each player. Player with the most VP is the winner. For the 2 player game, a dummy hand of tiles is dealt and players use that dummy hand as part of the hand passing portion of the game.

There are other card sequences that also score points. You Need: A Poker deck. You start play with two empty kitty piles in front of you. You may take a card from the deck and put it in one of your your kitty piles. You may only take one card at a time. The object of the game is to build kitty piles that have specific cards and card sequences in them. It's important to note that you can not rearrange the cards in your kitty pile during play or at the end of the game. That's why you need to pay attention the the cards you grab while you're playing. You're trying to build kitty piles with the following features: * Card pairs adjacent to each other that add to ten. A pair that adds to 10 is called a Tomcat. (worth three points) * Tens. A ten is called a Yowler. (worth one point) * One or more face cards of the same type sandwiched between two other cards of the same type. Each face card in a sequence like this is called a Jellical Cat. (worth two points) * An unbroken chain of black cards that adds to thirteen. This is called a Black Cat. (worth six points) The game ends when the deck runs out of cards or (if the game stalls) when someone yells, 'Black cat, black cat, crossin' my path. Don't look back or you'll get scratched!' The player with the highest point total wins.",

Players alternate turns placing their stones on the board, trying to score points by forming groups (ren) of 4 or 6 stones in a row or box formation. When a group or set of groups are formed, they are immediately scored, and immediately become vulnerable to the opponent, as the stones adjacent to the scoring stone become weak and are ready for removal. A lonely stone can be captured when totally surrounded, so there is a lot of movement on the board. Ren is copyrighted, but anyone can freely download and share it. The pdf document contains very concise rules with examples and diagrams, as well as a Ren board and cutout pieces, so all you need is a pair of scissors, download, print and play. download the pdf at www.mytaras.com/ren.html",

Six hexes, located along the outer edge of the board, are labelled with a letter. Players, on their turn, add a path of their colour that connects two adjacent hexes and a wall that blocks a path from being built there. In addition, players may convert a path to a wall and a wall into a path. Eventually, the six lettered hexes will be connected by a network of paths. At this point, the game ends. There will be three scoring routes on the board. Each scoring route connects a pair of letters and usually contains paths owned by more than one player. Players score one point for each path they own along each route. The player with the highest score wins. To assemble the print-and-play version, simply print the board, insert it into a plastic sheet protector, and use dry erase markers to draw paths and walls. Alternatively, print one of the other boards, which have smaller dimensions but larger hexes, and use Settlers of Catan roads as paths and small counters as walls.",

Players will start many scenarios without units and just a handful of money.  By building units and capturing cites, players can raise new capital in order to build bigger armies. If the design is successful, the possibility of incorporating armies from newer Advance Wars games will be considered.  This version will include 4 armies, CO's and special powers from the first Advance Wars game released on the Gameboy Advance.

        "description": "Two spice dealers share a storehouse with a number of hungry rats, who want to put them out of business.  The two dealers want to store spices so that they know where everything is, but they also have to keep the rats at bay.  Stack your crates, keep your spices together, and cover up the rats. Rat Hot is a two-player game developed from Michael Schacht's Dschunke: Das Legespiel on his own label Spiel aus Timbuktu , which in turn was developed from his game Dschunke , also published by Queen . The Rat Hot tile distribution differs slightly from Dschunke: das Legespiel but you can very nearly use the Dschunke: das Legespiel rules with a Rat Hot set. All the games use the clever mechanism of stacking long 3x1 tiles so that the upper tiles obscure some parts of the tiles underneath. In Rat Hot , the two players simply take turns to draw 2 tiles from a face down pile, and add them to the existing layout. The tiles are all 1x3 and show a combination of rats, spices or empty crates. Each player has four different types of spice in their player colour which they are trying to form into large groups. Many of the tiles have spices of both colours. The game is scored with grey and yellow chips which represent 1 and 2 points. Each time you place a tile, you and your opponent can score points from groups created or changed by that tile. Whenever a group of two of the same spice is formed, the owning player receives one point, or two points for groups of three or more. Beware! If there are three rats of your own colour visible at the end of your turn, you instantly lose. When the draw pile is exhausted and the tiles all placed, the board is scored once more for all players, so trying to preserve existing groups also counts. The real trick in the game comes in the tile placement. Tiles must be adjacent by at least one square. Tiles can placed on top of other tiles, so that stacks build up. But a tile can not sit exactly on top of another, so there must always be some offset, and all three squares of a tile must be supported by other tiles, or the table. Rat Hot can be very tricky. You want to keep your opponent's rats exposed in awkward places, so they have to spend both their moves trying to keep the rats covered. But you also want to set up scoring positions, and cover your own rats, and avoid giving your opponent points as well. There's a good mental challenge here, as you puzzle over the best use and arrangement of your tiles. Do you dare leave two of your rats open, because your opponent may draw more of your rats and make it impossible for you to finish your next turn with less than three showing. Can you get a good group of spices going and also break up your opponent's groups? Tricky problems for tricky minds. Rat Hot is a quick, fun game and is a good addition to Queen's line of small 2-player games. The wood chips make it easy to see who is leading, the tiles are nicely made, the graphics are fun, and the game plays quickly and fairly. You can be stuffed by unlucky tile draws, but perhaps your low score is more to do with your choices, or maybe the other player is just smarter than you. Fast play, easy rules, and the risk of sudden death give Rat Hot a high replay value.",

In summary, the sport of Buzkashi involves skilled horsemen who attempt to pick up a carcass (called the Boz) from the ground and then ride free of the other horsemen without allowing the Boz be taken away. Components: A circular board (made up of concentric circles which are in turn divided into rectangles to form the spaces); six playing pieces for each player (consisting of four attendants, one Chapandazan - a champion Buzkashi rider, and one Khan - the Chapandazan's sponsor); a pair of six-sided dice for each player; and a supply of poker chips or other markers used to track each player's score. The goal of the game is to move your Chapadazan to the Boz to take possession of it (grabbing it away from another Chapadazan if necessary) and get free from the rest of the riders or move off the playing board. This game was an entry in the 2005 Buzkashi Game Design Contest held here on BoardGameGeek.",

The game involves buying supplies to make the lemonade (cups, sugar, lemons and ice) and then selling the lemonade (hopefully for a profit).  The amount of lemonade that can be sold and the amount of profit is dependent on the weather and also on the prices charged by your competitors (the other players).  While you might sell lots of lemonade by setting a low price you won\u2019t be making much profit!  The game takes place over a week (from Monday to Sunday).  The person who is able to run their stall the most efficiently is likely to end the game with the most money and win the game!

A player must be aware at all times of what his opponents are doing, what cards are in play, how many plants/prey are available and who will be first or last in the turns to come.

The Captain's Game ignore the ships powers on the cards. Each player receives 5 ship tiles, one of each ship: Battleship, Destroyer, Aircraft Carrier, Submarine, Patrol Boat. Each player places them i front of them in any order to make up their fleet. On a player's turn they choose one of the ships in their Fleet to attack with and move it to the front of their line. Next the player chooses a ship of an opposing player to attack. The attacking player can only choose one of the first 2 ships in the line to attack. The attacking ship tile shows how many dice to roll. Roll that number of dice and check for hits. Each of the 8 dice is the same. 5 of the sides match the colors of the 5 ships, and the sixth side is a \u201cburst\u201d or \u201cwild\u201d. IF the player does not sink it, the dice are passed to the next player. Set aside any hits and then re-roll based on the attacking ship\u2019s powers. Once the number of hits equals or exceeds the defense number on the ship that's defending, it is sunk removed from play and the attacking player gets a point. The first player to an agreed number of set points wins. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the individual ship powers: Battleship: Declare target. Roll all 8 dice a total of 4 times. Bursts do not count as hits. Destroyer: Declare target. Roll 6 dice a total of 2 times. Bursts count as 2 hits. Aircraft Carrier: Roll 6 dice THEN declare your target, then roll 1 more time. Bursts count as 1 hit. The Aircraft Carrier can also attack from anywhere in your line, so you don\u2019t have to move it to the front where it is vulnerable. Submarine: Roll 3 dice a total of one time. A single Burst will sink whatever you are attacking. Submarines can attack any ship at any place in a Fleet. Patrol Boat: Roll 5 dice a total of 3 times. Bursts count as 1 hit. Part of the Hasbro Express Line .",

With his powerful army, each warlord expands across Eurasia conquering and pillaging the native peoples. The warlord who ships the richest plunder back to Mongolia will certainly be named the next Great Khagan (and win the game). At the start of each turn, the active player draws from his pool of available tumens (Mongolian army unit of 10,000 men). The drawn tumen tokens function as the player's army for the given turn. Players move their tumens to conquer new territories, receiving both resources and intimidation tokens, the latter of which can be strategically used to acquire even more territories. In the spirit of nomadic warfare, at the end of each turn, the active player must select one of his clans to encamp. All tumens of a differing clan are removed from play. Tumens of the chosen clan remain on the board, functioning as a springboard for future conquests on the player's next turn.",

        "description": "In Western Town , each player is a Marshal of an expanding town in the Old West of the U.S. in the early 1860s. Each Marshal wants to develop the most prosperous town, one that President Lincoln himself would be proud to visit. The three principal criteria that allow you to win the game are population growth, charm/attractiveness, and wealth, as measured by gold. Turns are regulated by the visits of Lincoln, who determines, bit-by-bit, the value of the towns relative to those three criteria. These criteria can and do change every round, and you will need to adapt to these changing criteria to win this game! Each player has his own board on which he will be building his town. Every building gives him different, and increasing, rights and abilities, and therefore power. The bigger your town gets, the better \u2013 but managing too much growth is challenging, so you'll need to make difficult choices at the beginning of each round as to which buildings you'll bring into play. This \"building-adding\" mechanism helps players stay in the game and not get lost in the overwhelming number of choices available. Of 22 different buildings, six of them are identified every round as \"bonus\" buildings, and players are forced to adapt varying strategies and test new combinations of these buildings for their town as the game progresses. In addition to logic and strategy, Marshals will need to bluff and occasionally resort to questionably bending the law a bit, to succeed in building their Western Town . And as if that weren't enough, there are even occasional Indian attacks to deal with as well!",

Each Mountain Climber is racing to be the first to the top. However, mountain climbing is tricky business -- taking risks is necessary to climb the mountain, but push it too far and you tumble backwards. The best balance of luck and risk wins the game. Mountain Climber is for 2 to 6 players, ages 8 and older. To play the game you need only download the rules and the game parts (a player board and 3 decision cards per player) and gather 2 markers and 3 dice per player.",

        "description": "Alien City is a game that is set in the far future and concerns the building of a city on a newly colonized world. Society in this distant time is divided into four powerful guilds. These are the Energy Guild (symbolized by a red sun), the Synthesis Guild (symbolized by a blue fountain), the Control Guild (the most powerful guild of all, symbolized by a green crown), and the Builder's Guild (symbolized by a black tool---yes, that's how tools look in the far future). Cities in this future contain two types of structures, towers and domes. Towers are owned by the various guilds. These are the power plants (energy), factories (synthesis), and government facilities (control). Domes are smaller structures used to house the citizens. As with the towers, domes are always associated with a particular guild. Both towers and domes are color-coded to identify guild affiliation; red for energy, blue for synthesis, green for control, and black for builders. Each of the guilds wants its towers positioned close to the towers and domes of other guilds (their customers) and far away from its own other towers (to avoid competing with other towers of their own guild). Location, location, location! Some things never change, even in the distant future. The Builder's Guild is unique because there are no Builder's Guild towers, i.e., no black towers. Instead, the Builders are compensated for their efforts by being given the profits of some of the other guilds\u2019 towers that the Builders choose as they construct the city. The players in this game are competing builders working to construct the city. At the same time, they are choosing towers for themselves that they hope will be profitable with many close customers and little competition. The choices must be made with care because each builder may only choose three. Red, blue, and green large Icehouse Pieces are used for the towers, and piecepack coins with the suit side up represent red, blue, green, and black domes. The land area of the city is defined by a 4x5 array of piecepack tiles, suit side up, with each tile representing four building sites. The game-play consists of the players alternating turns, placing a tower or dome each turn until either all available towers and domes have been placed or until there are no legal construction sites remaining within the city. Then scores are determined based upon the relative positions of the towers and domes. Winner of the piecepack Ludic Synergy design contest . Online Play Super Duper Games",

Included in each set are tiles to build the board, allowing for boards of various shapes and sizes, coins in varying suits and values, dice in suits and values, and player pawns. See Piecepack Game System for a detailed look at the system and its games. Thus far, over 100 games have been developed for piecepack sets, and since it is an open-source type system, new games appear frequently. The other interesting thing is that piecepack sets are public domain. Anyone can make one, even for profit, without paying any sort of royalties of any kind.  It is generally requested that they conform to some standard dimensions, but otherwise, they are free to make and sell. The suggested Piecepack dimensions make them compatible with Looney Pyramids .",

You need to close all the gates and kill all the monsters before Cthulhu wakes up and destroys everything. This game is an attempt to make an express version of Arkham Horror. The primary game mechanic is a \"Move/Effort\" system, in which 2 eight-sided dice are rolled, and one is used for movement and the other for actions. Higher numbers are better for both, but be careful. Every time you roll doubles, you are one step closer to defeat. The goal of the game is to completely remove the dark forces by closing all the gates and destroying all the monsters. Over the course of the game, various things (the biggest being rolling doubles at any time) cause the doom track to fill up. The players need to remove the dark forces before the track fills, or they all lose.",

The object of the game is to be the last hamster left in play. There are several hazards that make this challenging: The Conveyor Belt: You must keep moving up the Conveyor Belt or you'll get dumped off the edge into... The Alligator Pit: At the end of the Conveyor Belt is a pit with one or more hungry alligators in it. If it comes down to a battle between a hamster and an alligator, my money's on the reptile. Other hamsters: Other hamsters may try to push you into the Alligator Pit to increase their odds of being the last one in the game. Be careful! Fatigue: The stress of constant exertion will wear down even the heartiest hamster. You've got to stop running eventually you know... Instead of using dice, Run, Hamster, Run! has players put chips in a bag to determine the outcome of contests. This use of chips creates a strong focus on resource allocation. As the hamsters take damage or become fatigued, they lose chips from their pool, further emphasizing the importance of careful resource usage.",

Baseball Heroes is a light game but includes rules for outfield and infield fielding, dropped catches, bunts, base stealing, double plays, errors, runs, balls, strikes, bullpens and more.

First, players bid \u201cMega-Yen\u201d to control Godran.  Each turn, Godran could be controlled by a different player.  Victory point incentives will keep Godran rampaging - but if you win the bidding, Godran will rampage someplace other than your back yard! Mega-Yen can also be used to activate defense units, to evacuate panicked yet recalcitrant citizenry, and to develop super weapons to combat the mighty Godran.  Jury-rig a Death Ray and hope for a quick knockout punch, or undertake the longer and more expensive, but more sure-fire, process of researching Godran\u2019s origins to find his weakness. The Mega-Yen is an imaginary currency whose value, for the purposes of this game, is ridiculously high. \u201cOh No, There Goes Tokyo!\u201d plays essentially the same with two, three or four players. \u201cOh No, There Goes Tokyo!\u201d (Also known as ON,TGT!) contains a fold-out map that represents a hypothetical section of downtown Tokyo.  It could be any city, but Tokyo seems to be the most attractive to monsters.  Players are encouraged to substitute cities they particularly dislike if the urge strikes.  The game includes a set of counters representing Godran, destroyed buildings, the national guard in four colors and populace units in four colors.  Also included are a small selection of cards -  representing potential origin points for Godran and hair brained schemes to control the beast.  Relevant charts are included in the back of the rules for ease of access.  Play requires the use of multiple six sided dice to resolve combat and scrap paper for record keeping.",

        "description": "The land is corrupted. The silent Grayking, brooding upon his throne in the Tower of Ash, is a far-reaching shadow upon Lassadar. We feel his presence in each of our days. His servants grow bold, stealing into our cities, inhabiting the alleys and dark places of our streets. They jeer at us from our mirrors, shaming our reflections. The books of the Council of Wardens, handed down to us across the years, say that the era of broken barriers is upon us. Omens tell us, by winter, the Grayking will break through the few defenses we have remaining, cross to Lassadar, and our lands will fall to despair. We few who are left, who remember the Grayking\u2019s original imprisonment across the Barrier Planes, struggle to keep his power from growing further, but we have little time and far too few disciples. You are young but have proven to hold the strength of our teaching inside you. We have trained you in the arcane arts of ice, oak and flint magic and have taught you those powers are capricious and can damage your spirit if relied upon too much. We wish we had more time to train you further. We do not. Go now into the wider world, with our blessings, and seek a means to defeat the Grayking. Find the three Warding Keys stolen by his servants and re-lock the gates to force him back behind the Barrier Planes forever. Our agents, spread thinly across places still untouched in Lassadar, will aid you in your quest as best they can. Go now, and save us all\u2026\u2026 Shadows Upon Lassadar is a solitaire fantasy quest game. You play a young magic adept who has been charged with finding three lost keys to lock the gates between the Barrier Plains and prevent the Grayking from reaching the world of Lassadar. You will journey to different cities using a deck of cards; other cards list spells you learn during the game. Magic in Lassadar is, however, a two edged sword and if you use powerful spells you may end up corrupting your own spirit in the process and lose the game. Three specific cards lead to expanded battle maps where you fight the Grayking\u2019s servants for possession of the keys. The game uses a variety of AI mechanics to simulate an enemy that learns and adapts as the game progresses. Needed to play: the 48 game cards + the 4 last battle cards 9 six sided dice 25 black eurocubes and 3 eurocubes: one each in red, blue and yellow. This Print and Play game can be assembled as a deck of cards or as cards and a series of mini game boards. There are several types of quests in the game that will need to be completed. These quests are encountered by turning over cards from the draw deck: City Quest cards showing the name of the city you\u2019ve journeyed to, win and loss table reference icons and event instructions for the battle in that city. As you win battles in these cities you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles. Council of Wardens Quest cards always have a white top. Their event instructions will help you gain spells and refresh your Mana and Spirit. These cards will always be placed on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game. Three Warding City Quest cards, each with a colored band and a numbered Warding Key icon across the bottom will signal when you use the Expanded Battle Maps (wargame hexmap style). On the Expanded Battle Maps you will encounter AI driven servants of the Grayking. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles. As you win the battles in these cities, and gain the Warding Keys, you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile, to be shuffled back into the game. Winning or losing the game: Draw cards one by one working your way through the quest. If you gain each of the 3 Warding keys you may cast the Oaken Spell: Barrier Lock and lock the gates of the Barrier Plains. The Grayking is instantly drawn back to the Tower of Ash and you have saved Lassadar and won the game. If at any time your Spirit falls below [1] on the Character Stats card, or if the Grayking reaches Lassadar on the Progress Track, you have lost the game. 2nd place in the August 2011 Solitaire Print and Play contest and was also awarded Best Art, Best AI and Best Horror Game Tied for 1st place in The 2011 Print 'n Play Awards for Best Solitaire Game 2012 Golden Geek Awards Nominee - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/864240/2012-golden-geek-awards-nominees-announced-vot",

        "description": "Mini Combat is a generic rule set for massive battles using small scale miniatures. The rules are generic enough to play historical, fantasy and sci-fi battles. It is also possible to play across genres. How would fantasy Orcs fare against the American Confederate army or WWII Nazis against the Alien horde? These rules can be used stand alone where you can pick and choose what sections you will use or they can be used with Source books that define the rules, army lists and objectives of the battles. The miniature scale was designed for 1:300 (6mm) to 1:1000 (2mm) although we have played with 1:185 (10mm) for Fantasy and 1:5000 for Naval combat. What you need to play: In addition to the rules, you will need figures to represent each side, at least two six sided dice (D6) and a ruler or tape measure. http://www.geocities.com/shaungamer88/mini.htm",

        "description": "To The Last Man! is a strategic level wargame of World War 1 covering all aspects of the western front. To The Last Man! uses cards to allow units to fight, take replacements and affect the course of the game with key technological, military, and political events. Players alternate playing cards and moving pieces. The game sequence is very interactive, with NO down time waiting for the other player to take his turn. The combat system has both players rolling dice in each combat. In this two-player game each player starts the campaign game and 1914 scenario with cards that also represent the prewar stocks of ammunition, reserves and planning that allows the war to start off with a large bang. After players expend this allotment of cards, they must purchase more cards along with new units. Each player's resources are limited, so players often will not be able to launch large offensives every turn. They'll need to husband their resources. This represents the preparation for the next \"Big Push.\" All of this leads to difficult game decisions all the way through the game. There are scenarios for each year of the war from 1914 to 1918, along with the hypothetical Fuller or 1919 offensive. Also included are the many war plans conceived prior to the war and their appropriate set-ups so you could, for example, try the French 1909 plan vs. the German Schlieffen Plan. Rules include: Great Offensives, Stosstruppen, tanks, gas attacks, cavalry, huge dogfights, reserves, siege guns, forts, events on other fronts, and much more.",

Taking turns to move their tank and helicopter units, players get into position to attack the Monster. They can win \"Monster Hit\" cards by successfully firing at the Monster and fulfilling the conditions on the cards. If the city is flattened before the Monster is defeated, the Monster wins!",

        "description": "The Horsemen of Buzkashi is a card game for 2-4 adventurous horsemen which simulates the national pastime of Afghanistan. Teams of horsemen try to gain control of the Boz, traditionally a decapitated sheep or goat, and carry the Boz around a flagpole set away from the center of activity, and then bring the Boz back to a set circle or goal area on the field called the Hallal. A successfully deposited Boz within the Hallal scores a point for that team. Objective: Score the most points by dropping the Boz into the Hallal after two halves of play. If at the end of the second half, there is a tie for most points, then a freeforall period is played with everyone (even those who did not have the most points), with the first player to score declared the winner of the game. Otherwise, the team with the most points at the end of the game wins! Components: 40 action cards; 24 combo cards; 120 rider cards (5 chapandaz and 25 pakir for each of the four teams - Turkmen, Mongol, Tajik and Nuristani horsemen); one six-sided die; a Boz marker; and a Flagpole marker. Each rider has individual statistics for strength, speed, tactics, and boz skill. Further, each team is designed to have a different flavor; the Turkmen tend to be the fastest riders, the Mongols the strongest, the Nuristani the best tacticians, and the Tajik are pretty well-rounded. This game was an entry in the 2005 Buzkashi Game Design Contest held here on BoardGameGeek.",

Each player has 2 pieces which are placed one at a time on the bank spaces on the outside edge of the board. Each player also has a list with the numbers 1 through 9 written on it. On a player's turn, he moves his pieces 3 to 5 spaces along the outside of the board, trying to form an intersection with a number. Each time the player forms an intersection with a number, he marks it off his list. The first player to mark all 9 numbers of his list wins. http://www.printgames.net/english/matrix/detail_e.htm",

        "description": "March of War is a game of fantasy combat between distinct racial armies for between two and four players. Each player commands one of the armies in an attempt to conquer his foes in an ultimate bid to best the opposing player's generals. Units are represented by square tiles, which list the unit's combat strength in each direction, as well as any special abilities the unit may possess. Players attempt to place their tiles in key positions to bolster their own defenses while trying to maximize their position against their opponents tiles. Each player receives a number of action points to spend on his turn. These action points allow the player to perform such actions as playing new tiles, initiating combat, activating special tile abilities, etc. Combat between tiles always results in at least one tile being removed from the board. When this occurs, other tiles \"march\" in to fill the gap, potentially moving tiles closer or farther away from their targets. The victor is the last player with a general in play.",

Each character has his/her own objectives to get besides surviving. For example, a stunt man must find his daughter & a vaccine while a high school girl needs to find her brother. Each character earns a certain victory points if he/she got the right people/item AND arrived at the security room OR exit to parking lot. However, the security room & the exit door are both locked. You must get the key/keycard before others getting them. Players will meet new survivors in the mall during exploration. You may ask them to join you by giving items they want. You earn extra VPs by escorting them to safety. However, food, weapons & ammo are limited. Players must compete with each other for food & ammo while sharing with his partner survivors. Beside the brainless zombies, there are other hostile enemies like terrorists, psychopaths & mystic cultists. So players may also need to co-operate with each other to survive against the hordes of enemies. You have to plan when to co-operate & when to betray the other players. Players with most VPs at game end wins.",

The left-centre-right wing Battle Cry/Memoir '44 principle has here been replaced by colour-coding the units red, green and blue (activated by command cards of the same colour) thus enabling the players to concentrate their units anywhere on the battlefield if they wish so.\" Units can only be moved, battle or execute a special action according to the orders written on these cards. To calculate the result of combat, special battle dice called \"dice in dice\" or \"double dice\" are used (search the net for suppliers, there are several).",

People of all ages and backgrounds started pouring in, even from beyond the great Wall, driven by the irresistible urge to have their dreams made true. The pilgrimage, a trial in itself, killed many at the hands of the Scourges or the Infekted, but those who made it are now called the Circle Of the Eighty-Eight, and the Preacher - their shepherd. The first trial, an unnatural selection process, will comprise of a series of auto races in which the Circle members will drive heavily armed vehicles to the death. With every type of car declared eligible, many in the Eighty-Eight started smuggling in their vehicles from across the Wall while others started tinkering with the Zone\u2019s own war refuse. Thus begins Autokross-88. So the last shall be first, and the first last for many be called, but few chosen. The Preacher Players will choose and control one of the 88ers throughout the Preacher's series of trials. During each crucible, Circle members will have to pick a vehicle and customize it with different offensive/defensive weapons and equipment in an attempt to gain the edge over their rivals. Death racing will take place in the Zone's hexagonal map tile built wastes through hostile weather, Infekted hordes and unscrupulous comrades.",

        "description": "You are a modern day shaman and supernatural champion. Waging your secret war against dark forces intent on reshaping the universe, you also face off against destiny in the wake of an uncertain prophecy that foretells destruction but gives the promise of hope. Across the world, the infant Queens of Fate are being reincarnated into the world. Can you find them before the dark powers get to them? -- These are the complete instructions on how to play a solitaire game called Queens of Fate, using only a deck of tarot cards and a large playing surface. I made up this game as a tool to help me learn to use and interpret the multi-faceted meaning of the tarot cards in different ways, and soon found both the game and its story to be quite addictive. Gameplay consists of turning over cards from the deck, one at a time and resolving them.  Depending on the type of card (classified in the game as Opposition, Arcana, Source, or Court), you will either play it into your play area, confront it in a challenge, or compare it to the previous card drawn. You have a set of Arcana cards and Source cards to use in battles, but each can only be used once. The strategy of the game involves using (discarding) cards you have in play when an Opposition card comes up, or deciding whether not to confront at all and deal with the consequences.  Playing cards in certain combinations allows you to \"resurrect\" cards from the discard pile. The goal is to play the four Queens, and place one in each suite-themed play area.  If you run out of cards before this happens, you lose the game.  The Queens can be lost through losing battles to Obstacle cards, which may attack your Court cards or random cards from your deck.",

        "description": "Get in a queue with your family in front of a store and experience a rush of genuine emotions! The board game Kolejka (a.k.a. Queue ) tells a story of everyday life in Poland at the tail-end of the Communist era. The players' task appears to be simple: They have to send their family members out to various stores on the game board to buy all the items on their shopping list. The problem is, however, that the shelves in the five neighborhood stores are empty. The players line up their pawns in front of the shops without knowing which shop will have a delivery. Tension mounts as the product delivery cards are uncovered and it turns out that there will be enough product cards only for the lucky few standing closest to the door of a store. Since everyone wants to be first, the queue starts to push up against the door. To get ahead, the people in the queue use a range of queuing cards, such as \"Mother carrying small child\", \"This is not your place, sir\", or \"Under-the-counter goods\". But they have to watch out for \"Closed for stocktaking\", \"Delivery error\", and for the black pawns \u2013 the speculators \u2013 standing in the queue. Only those players who make the best use of the queuing cards in their hand will come home with full shopping bags. On the product cards are photos of sixty original objects from the Communist era. The merchandise includes Relaks shoes, Przemys\u0142awka eau de cologne, and Popularna tea, as well as other commodities that were once in scarce supply. The neighborhood also has an outdoor market but the prices there are steep \u2013 unless, of course, you manage to strike a deal with the market trader. In this realistic game you really have to be savvy to get the goods. Are you brave enough to confront the everyday life of the 1980s?",

As a commanding officer you try to win the battlefield by scouting and destroying the enemy and by capturing urban areas. Company Leader is not meant as a simulation of statistics, but as a game in which you are challenged to take the right tactical decisions in order to win. Therefore, the aim is for fairly simple rules. The game focuses on scouting, concealing and movement of your troops. Fog of war is the root of Company Leader and this is symbolized by gaming pieces on the game board. At the start of the game your troops are not visible to the enemy, neither can you see his. You will have to scout to reveal them and keep scouting to prevent them from hiding again.",

Armed with a Spellbook and with the aid of the enchanted Element-Stones, the sorcerers summoned fantastic Creatures and magical Spells. A wizard who had no more pages left in his Spellbook would eventually have lost the magical battle of wits. The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent\u2019s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). Is a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.",

An action consists of rolling all the dice and picking one set to use. You can choose occupations, which help you manipulate the dice before you select your set of dice to use. You may build improvements, which help you score points or convert produce or animals into food. You may improve your farm by extending your house, plowing fields, or building pastures. You may gather Produce (food, grain, or vegetables), Resources (reed, wood, brick, or stone), or Animals (sheep, boars, or cattle). And, of course, you can have babies--but only if you have room in your house. After each harvest, you score points based on how well you've done. You might lose points. The person whose total score across all 3 harvests is the highest wins.

There is no 'Zombie Master' here: all the players are on the same side, all working together to survive, although the option to use other players as zombie bait while you grab all the guns and lock yourself in the cellar is there if you prefer. Either way, you will need to use strategy and your (fresh and spicy) brains as well as chainsaws and shotguns to make it through the night. Each scenario has a location to be explored, and an objective to be fulfilled, but if things don't go well just survival may be enough. Cards drawn throughout the game may help or hinder your progress, but as the night draws on you can be sure things are going to get much worse before you see the sun again. The game ends when somebody fulfils the main objective (eg, escaping in a fuelled up vehicle), or at daybreak, which brings respite in the form of an advancing army patrol. If you can survive until the end of the game, you are a winner. The survivor who best fulfils their objectives will come out on top. Expanded by: Mall of the Dead",

Players place tiles to build paths, and move their pieces along paths, sometimes jumping onto another path. The object of the game is to score the most points by completing paths containing your piece. Contents 4 Player pieces A set of 35 Playing tiles Wend tiles are square in shape, and have 2 path entry/exit points on each edge. They each have four path sections which go from one path entry/exit point to another. When placed side by side, the path sections from one tile join up with those on the adjacent tile, to create meandering paths. There are 35 Wend tiles in a set, which includes one copy of all possible different combinations of 4 path sections on a tile. A single set of 35 Wend tiles is enough for a good game with 2-4 players. You can use extra sets of Wend tiles to accommodate more players or for a longer and more challenging game with a small number of players.",

        "description": "Agora is a game about drawing and laying cards (acting as tiles) to form a highly abstracted Greek marketplace. What sets the game apart from other games in the tile-laying genre is that the cards can be placed almost anywhere on the board and in almost any orientation.  Cards may touch at corners.  The corner of one card may touch the side of another.  When placed edge-to-edge, the cards are not even required to align perfectly, only grid line to grid line. Players advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. An additional random factor comes from the giving each player a letter--A, B, C or D--which activates random events if the tile they draw bears their letter. Victory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points. Since revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass's Hip Pocket Games series",

        "description": "Space Clash is a non-collectible card game for 2 - 4 interplanetary warlords in which each player chooses one out of four exciting races, each being represented by a well balanced deck of 40 cards featuring unique gameplay, and tries to lead his race to different ways of victory, be it by total military annihilation of the enemy or by cultural domination. In Space Clash, many roads lead to victory, the goal being to deplete the opponent's 40 card deck. When a player is required to draw a card from their Supply (deck) but cannot because it is empty, the player immediately loses the game. For each damage a player takes through attacks or card effects, they have to discard the topmost card from their Supply to their Junkyard (discard pile). The game features the tried and tested \"Clash Game System\" created by Andreas Propst, which features 3 major characteristics: a) Deck depletion as the primary win condition. b) A resource system in which you will be building stacks of resource cards to play your non-Resource cards onto c) Different Zones for different types of cards with specific implications on the cards, depending on which zone they are in Build up your industry, construct spaceships to attack your opponents or to defend against enemy attacks, train personnel like ship crews, researchers, diplomats and spies, research new technology or try to dominate through diplomacy or dodgy schemes and political intrigue. The possibilities in Space Clash are countless... Which race will you choose? The versatile and inventive Terrans, who are able to adapt well to any challenge they might face? The reptilian warrior race of the Skaargans, with their supreme ability to construct, mend and salvage? The dodgy and scheming Intrazi, who have perfected the art of telepathy, becoming the masters of secrets? Or the ancient and mysterious Attrayids who are rather passive but excell in gathering wisdom and knowledge? Choose your race and lead it to victory by carefully planning your strategy and making the best use of the their unique strenghtes and abilities.",

        "description": "In Route Z players are trying to get a mini-bus down the road.  The bus is escorted by 6 cars.  Ahead of them are a horde of zombies, behind them the rumble of zombies on motorcycles.  If they can defend the bus long enough, a ritual being cast on the bus will destroy all of the zombies. Route Z is a cooperative game. From the game: \"The war was bad. One hell of an understatement, but it was nothing compared to what came next. Zombies. Sure, laugh it up. It\u2019s easy to do when you are surrounded by your friends and not by a horde of putrid cadavers breathing rot down your neck. If it had just been zombies we would have been fine. What is dead once can be made dead again; but these were puppets of evil humans, or rather, necromancers. They were using found magic to reanimate the thousands fallen during the war. Rumors spread that they had gotten a copy of the true Necronomicon but those were only rumors because we have the only real copy. Now we are fleeing for our lives with it in a battered school bus trying to incant the one spell that will send these blighted things back to whence they came. Our team is ragtag but our vehicles are fast. Hopefully they are fast enough to outrun the necromancers riding double on bikes: that\u2019s right, they taught the damned things to ride Harleys.\" Voting for the contest this game is in can be done: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/439899",

Any unit can perform various roles \u2013 explorer, worker, priest, scientist, soldier \u2013 at different times during the game, and the modular game board further contributes to the game\u2019s flexibility. Moreover, Oikodomos can be played with any number of players for which components are available: one, two, six, or even twelve if necessary. (Playing time depends on the number of players, however: for experienced players approximately 90 minutes per player; for new players a bit more.) As in any civilization game, players start with a small tribe (represented by a single unit), build their first city, and start developing technology. More cities are build, and the land around those cities are cultivated to feed the growing population. With population growth, however, dissent rises, and leaving that unchecked results in revolt. Throughout the game, players should balance growth, development, and the 'happiness' of their citizens. Losing that balance may turn out disastrous later. Too much focus on technological development, for example, may hamper population growth, or leave insufficient means to counter growing dissent; while too much focus on economic growth may hurt scientific progress.",

Tarot cards make up the often-changing board, and players use Icehouse Pieces to represent minions that control those territories. Every tarot card has a power, and when a player has one of his pieces on a territory, he or she may use the power of that territory through that piece. Players also have a hand of tarot cards which allow them to use those powers through any of their pieces. Territories are worth points when occupied, and the game ends when one player challenges the other players and has 9 points on his or her following turn. Gnostica is a redevelopment of Zarcana . Re-implemented by Zark City , and Dectana .  The former is much simpler and uses a poker deck, while the latter is more complex and uses the Decktet .

        "description": "S-P-O-N-G-E: Fight the Evil is a customizable card game based on the adventures of S-P-O-N-G-E (see http://s-p-o-n-g-e.com) , an online role-playing organization devoted to H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos (it took me quite a while to find out that \"SPONGE\" stands for \"Stopping Powerful Organisms from N Gulfing Everything\").  It is nominally a two-player game but can handle more players quite readily. In the game, each player is a SPONGE Historian, helping out on an investigation.  The Historian position at SPONGE is often a short-lived one, and the \"Inactive Files\" are full of past Historians that didn\u2019t make it.  The object of the game is to last longer than any of your fellow Historians. Each player also represents the forces of Evil that threaten to thwart SPONGE at every turn.  This means that you will be playing cards on your opponents as often as you play them on yourself. Every Historian has his or her own deck of cards, comprised of seven categories: Locations (where your investigation takes you), Characters (people you encounter), Items (stuff you find), Weapons (stuff you find that will kill Beasts), Beasts (an assortment of creatures bent on killing you), Tomes (knowledge man was not meant to know) and Events (things that just happen to happen). Each turn you normally get two Action Points.  It costs an Action Point to draw a card, play a card or perform certain Special Abilities --discarding is free, however.  Some card abilities cost more than one Action Point (some cost more than two!).  Unused Action Points are passed on to the next player. Icons appear on the cards and act to guide play --each card brings icons in play, and each card requires certain icons to be in play before it can be played. There are numerous ways to lose the game.  Basically, any action that would put you into one of the Inactive Files (Known Dead, Presumed Dead, Asylum, Missing, Resigned, Inaccessible or Other) also puts you out of the game.  The only exception is the Reanimated file.  If you die and get reanimated, you can keep playing the game, but you will suffer certain restrictions, making \"winning\" more difficult.",

Other event cards will make the players' ants fight (possibly losing the eggs they're carrying) or allow them to change their ant army, or even allow them to steal the other players' eggs.  Once all the events are drawn, the game ends and the player with the most eggs wins. Antagon is one of Kidult Games' free, \"print-n-play\" games available on their website.",

Object: To demolish your opponent's vehicle while keeping yours intact. You Need: * A standard-sized chess- or checkerboard * Two dice * Two pawns or other markers * Scrap paper (to keep track of damage) * A set of 64 Yield! tiles (available for download on the game's website) The board is made up of tiles that represent road sections. Players take turns laying tiles on the checkerboard until all the tiles have been played. Gameplay consists of moving your pawn (your vehicle) around the board, attempting to collide with the other players under circumstances which will damage their vehicle and not yours. When you receive ten points of damage, you are out of the game. The last player remaining wins.",

Players use cards to bid over Cows, Pigs, and Hens which appear in random combinations each round of play. Points are scored based on the number of animals a player has in his farm at the end of each round. The strategy lies in knowing which animals will start paying off early and in capitalizing on the \"Haystack Cards\" which allow for various bonuses depending on the characteristics of your farm at the end of the 8 rounds of play. Players may also plant fields which can pay off really well as long there's no drought.",

        "description": "Fungibility is a strategic, Euro-style, economic engine, resource management card game for 2-4 players, which uses 108 cards, and no other components. Fungibility is also a financial term, referring to commodities which are functionally indistinguishable from one another, such as currency, graded crude oil, and pure gold. In keeping with this concept, the cards in Fungibility (the card game) are all identical copies of the same card. To create some degree of randomness, the deck is shuffled, first with half the cards rotated, then a second time with half the cards flipped face-up. The facing, position, and even rotational orientation of cards relative to each player's seating position has a logically distinct meaning within the game, meaning that the same card in the supply may have completely different meanings to each player. The basic game is free to print and play. It is the author's intent that, should the game be published and sold at retail, the retail cards would include art elements unreferenced by the core rules. As of writing, the author has three expansions designed, each of which would merely describe rules for the unreferenced art elements, and which would be made available free of charge, post release.",

Items will modify your attack value when determining the outcomes of battles, but they do not add to your health.  For example, if your base vitality is 5, and you have taken 4 damage, 1 more damage will end the game even if you have a weapon that adds 2 to your attack. Pick one non-epic item to start the game with.  Unless otherwise specified, your hero can only carry two items.  Shuffle the remaining non-hero cards.  This is the draw deck. Start turning over the cards in the draw deck, one at a time and resolving them until you either reach the end of the deck and have won, or your hero is dead.",

Meanwhile, you will increase the political, religious and economical influence of your tribe. By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock. All this to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya! Players program their caravans around the paths on the Himalayan plateau to collect various goods, and then deliver them.  Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks. The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.  This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games.",

The game has a very simple mechanic: after the players have chosen their squad (made of 6 different character, picked from the character pile, each with a specific background, image and abilities), they randomly place the locations (represented by cards) in which the fight takes place. Then draw equipment cards, and, one at time, each player can perform, during his turn, the following actions: 1. draw up to 2 arsenal/equipment cards 2. equip up to 2 arsenal cards to the characters 3. move a character from a location to another 4. activate a character to use an equipped item Once equipped, a card is used by rolling one D10: if the player rolls higher than the activation number (written on the equipment card), the item is successfully used, and players deal with its effects; otherwise, the card has no effect, and is discarded. As simple as that. But to give the game morespice, locations and character abilities give die roll modifications, so, for example, if you need to roll a 5+ to successfully use a rifle, but your character sucks at using ranged weapons, your roll will have  a -1 modifier, so you'll need 6+. Modifiers will stack, so a bonus given by the character will add up to any bonuses or detractions given by locations, and vice-versa. As if this was not enough, hidden among the arsenal cards, there are event cards, that, when drawn, make an event happen (from earthquakes, which will destroy a location, to spies, that will make one of your characters change faction; from swarm attacks, that will make characters loose their equipment, to the arrival of mercenaries that will add a new character to the opposing squad). These events are actually thought to discourage players from continually drawing arsenal cards, and to randomize things around.",

        "description": "Open Rails Origins - 18AL is a hybrid of several game systems, most notable 18XX, Age of Steam and Chicago Express as well as some other unique twists to create a compact yet challenging train game experience. Play begins with players participating in an auction to buy shares in one of five railroads represented in 19th century historic Alabama.  Cubes are used to lay track, represent engines you have acquired and to track your income and stock price.   The price you set on your initial stock purchase determines how many cubes you have to work with.  Railroads may build stations to block a rival's advances, upgrade cities.  Each turn your railroad may decide to save money to buy further locomotive upgrades to force your competitors to buy more expensive trains that they can't afford - or they can pay out to their investors to ultimately drive up stock price.  Play moves fast and fortunes can change in the blink of an eye. The object is to make more money than your fellow robber barons by holding the most valuable stocks and acquiring the most cash through deliveries through the game. The game is playable for one to three players.  The one player version takes about 20 minutes to play after the initial pass through the rules.  Experienced players should be able to get through the two and three player versions of the game in 60-90 minutes. This game is a print and play release of the Open Rails train game system.  Poker chips, 1 cm cubes or smaller, a pair of scissors and the means to print out four sheets of 8 x 10 paper are all that are needed to play. Please visit http://www.jkntech.com/blog/page/Open-Rails-Origins---18AL-Board-Game.aspx for game materials and more information.

Players represent different Emirates that are rivals for control after Muhammed\u2019s death at the end of his conquests. Each player controls an area on the map, along with a number of army units with which he can battle others and take over more territory. In addition to combat, there are economic issues to attend to. Emirates produce a number of goods according to the size of area controlled, and players trade surplus commodities with each other to generate earnings. This trade income is combined with taxes to pay the required expenses of maintaining the army and to purchase infrastructure improvements.",

        "description": "The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance! The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination. Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players\u2019 identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game. Rule Correction: For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: \"Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.\" and \"...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)\" - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.",

This Game was designed for the 24 hour contest - May 2013 \"They said it would be easy, you thought it would be simple, go and collect flowers to sell at the market - what could go wrong!?  That was until you met the Rats, no ordinary rats - these are definitely of an unusual size, but they are nothing compared to the fearsome Scorpions.\" Players take turns to roll the dice and spend those points on drawing cards.  There are four decks to choose from, each deck costs a different amount to draw a card. The more expensive the cards the greater the value of the flowers in the decks, but the higher the risk of drawing a scorpion and leaving with nothing.  Players must decide whether to risk it and draw from the more valuable decks or play it safe with a cheap deck that guarantees they earn at least some money.  Rolling a double on the dice will let you choose between 2 cards so should be safer, but do you keep trying for a double or take the bonus for leaving without uncovering a Rat.  Ending your turn lets you sell your flowers at the market for coin, and at the end of the game whoever has the most coin wins.",

Eric Herman designed the game with the same core audience in mind as his music fans (elementary school kids and their parents). Blackbeard, Bluebeard and Redbeard is a very lightly weighted and semi-abstract \"race to get the most treasure\", but it also incorporates some nice Eurogame touches, including action point movement, card combinations, minimal luck and variable victory point options.  As such, it is an excellent gateway game for younger players on the verge of discovering more involved games like Settlers and Tikal. The game is designed in the low-cost tradition of (James Ernest's company), with pennies, nickels and dimes used for treasures, and tokens from other games used as the game pieces, and with a great amount of humor in the cards. Blackbeard, Bluebeard and Redbeard is currently in playtesting and is expected to be available in 2008.",

Both variants require additional components to 1830: Railways & Robber Barons to play (files are provided to make your own) and assumes familiarity with the 1830: Railways & Robber Barons rules. Though this uses components of 1830 this is not an expansion, but is a separate standalone game.",

        "description": "The night before June 6th, 1944, during Operation Neptune, thousands of Allied troops were parachuted into enemy territory to prepare the Normandy landings. During that crucial night, amid the flashes of German anti-aircraft fire, many paratroopers were scattered a long way from their drop zones as their planes were either destroyed or unable to reach their drop points. You are among those troopers. But as luck turns out, the winds have blown you directly where you are needed the most! As you were descending, you discovered a terrible sight: the Germans have installed two 24.0 cm Guns in a hidden bunker. Those cannons are set to fire at the beaches of Normandy. You alone can stop them from killing the Allied troops! During your jump, you lost your equipment bag which contained all your necessary gear. The only thing you have left is your trusted Colt .45 and your ingenuity. As you fold your parachute, you look at your watch: it\u2019s 0700, the landings are starting. Will you have time to sabotage the German battery before they decimate your comrades? All you need are some explosives... This game started out as a variant of Zombie in my Pocket , but now has become its own game, with Event cards, inside and outside tiles, scenario cards, item tiles and character cards. Airborne In Your Pocket: Free Trial Version can be simple (Basic Game) or more involving (Scenarios & Campaigns), as the player wishes. Advanced Game and Scenarios allow you to play as American, British, Canadian, French and even German soldiers.  And the expansions bring even more variety with alternate cards and locations. So join the airborne! Fight the enemy! Win the war! Re-implemented by: Airborne In Your Pocket",

It is a game where strategically planning your movements is essential. Every driver has his own deck of \"movement cards\" which include straight lines, curves, braking and overtaking cards. Each round you may pick up a maximum of 4 cards, in the order you wish to play them, you then move your driver's car according to the cards directions, around the track. But be careful, picking all 4 cards every time could result in collisions with other drivers, going off the track, or running out of fuel. Before a race begins, you must choose your fuel load and tyre types according to different variables, such as weather conditions, where warmer temperatures result in quicker tyre wear, and also your fuel strategy, as you must choose your race fuel for qualifying. To make these decisions, you look at the various statistics on your driver's information cards, and place markers upon the starting fuel load, and reliablity statistics, which change over the course of the race.",

But, that\u2019s just the beginning! Wizard Dodgeball allows teams to throw spells in addition to balls. Boost your team, freeze your opponents, teleport balls back to your side, and watch out for fireballs!\" Players are dealt a team of 5 wizards each and the turn order is determined by the order of the deal. Players then select spell cards based on how many spells their team can have. For gameplay, each wizard has two action points that can be spent on moving, throwing balls, casting spells, or some combination. Picking up or putting down balls is a free action. Each wizard has a physical and magical range, and physical and magical attack and dodge bonuses. The outcome of throwing/casting and dodging is handled by high roll on d6's, tie goes to the defender.",

A Thousand Years of Blood is a solitaire game where the player takes on the role of a superhuman in an alternate-universe future. After Hitler's assassination in 1944, a superhuman named Heinrich Kirchner took power over Nazi Germany. Under his reign, the Nazis took over the world. As a virtual immortal, Heinrich began a thousand-year Reich. You are a Nazi experiment with superhuman abilities of your own. And you plan to end Heinrich's rule and put a stop to his thousand-year plans. The game requires a simple PocketMod, a pencil, a d6, and a d8.  The player selects two of seven unique abilities, then uses the dice to randomly generate the maps of the three levels.  Actual gameplay in the first two levels in completely non-random, as the player seeks to move from the Start point of the map to the End point while taking as little damage as possible from the various enemies.  If you end your turn in an enemy's line of sight, you take damage, so watch out!  The third level is less about sneaking and more about combat, so there is more randomization--Heinrich teleports to different points on the map while activating Laser Turrets and blasting you with lightning.",

        "description": "Taken from the publisher's website: The Artifact takes us in a fantasy world far away, where humans, magical and evil creatures can be easily found walking around, just as in any Tolkien-inspired game. Players take up the role of one of these heroes (a Human, a Dwarf, an Elf and a Hobbit, indeed) and must recover their weapon, which is proved to be the only mean to destroy a powerful Artifact that is trying to put under its control the whole world. The path to the Mountain of Fate, the place where the Artifact is giving out its will, is full of dangerous creatures such as Trolls, Orcs and the mighty Black Knight. During his turn, the player rolls two different colored six-sided dice, thus determining both his hero movement and which of the evil character will be moved by the player sitting to his right. You got it: players are trying both to win advantage for their heroes and to stop the other players' ones at the same time. And if it's not your lucky day, you may even change the outcome you have rolled, but are you ready to pay its price, giving your opponents a free move? The game gets even more interesting because each evil character has its own special ability, and the map represents different types of terrain: each hero has a favored type of terrain (e.g. woods for the Elf) where he can peacefully rest and plan his next moves. Last but not least, there is also the possibility of casting a powerful spell and then bend evil characters' wills to yours... This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.",

        "description": "A game for 2 to 4 players on a kinetic, ever changing board. The object, to collect 5 unique Tokens Cards and return to the Start Tile before your opponents. A game of logic, on a chaotic board, there is no luck involved (okay, very, very little luck). Just the timing of events created by you and your opponents given the limited options available to the players. Player options (including tile movement and token stealing) are determined by the board tile upon which their pawn rests (each tile allows 2 to 3 options for the player) and the hidden Power Up Cards each player chose at the beginning of the game. Player's must weigh their options wisely to determine the most advantageous choice for themselves while undermining their opponents! There are two versions of the exact same game available. A Full Color Version, all inclusive, full game, print and play; and/or a Black and White \"CB\" Version (the original game testers' ashcan version), players will need to supply a deck of cards and a token for each player for the B&W version. The rules are short, simple and contained in a single PocketMod, included in each of the above sets. Winner: 2011 Print and Play Award for Best Abstract Game",

Using a unique system of 12 mapboard tiles to represent the various star systems in the Outrim sector, it captures the tense uncertainty and the sudden, flashing battles of an interstellar war. Units represented include Viking cruisers, sloops, and fighters. Federate and local frigates, battle-cruisers, and patrol boats, as well as raiding detachments, security forces, grav-armor units, specialized warfare pods, and conventional low-tech armed forces ranging from atmospheric aircraft to stone-age hordes.\" A print-and-play version of this game is available for free , authorized download from http://dwarfstar.brainiac.com/ds_starviking.html",

Your goal is at the same time to be the only master of some planets, and also to share other planets with your opponents. War, politics and ecology are your tools in this difficult task. Use them skillfully to attract partners on your worlds or prevent them from being invaded. \" Solarii uses cards to solve the interactions between players and to build the board. It's a powerful system that makes every game different from the previous ones. \"This game was among the 80 semi-finalists at the 2003 edition of the Game Design Contest Of Boulogne-Billancourt in France.\"",

Your mission is to get to your destination with your spaceship and to destroy as many invaders as you can. You move your spaceship on an area that is made of paper strips. Each turn, you remove the lowest strip and add a new one above the others : the \"boardgame\" always changes. Your spaceship moves up one square. If a meteorite or some invaders come accross your way, you have to fight them with 1, 2 or 3 dice. The game ends when you reach the Destination strip or when your Armor points come down to 0. Then you count your points : 50 is a good score.",

Also, the asylum tries to keep as many of its patients in group therapy at a time as it can. Players invest their tempo(represented by metronomes) to obtain the materials, time, and inspiration needed to complete the pieces haunting them. There are currently two card decks, one for 3-4 players and one for 5-6.",

There are five resources that are farmed by all players throughout the game. Players collectively keep track of plagues which eventually end the game. Aside from the seven resource dice, there are three speculation dice which allow players to increase the amount of dice they roll each turn and to modify the results of their dice. Scoring is done as in Nile the card game where your score is equal to the resource of which you have the least. One major difference in Nile: the Dice Game from the original card game is the solo option. In a solo game you are challenging an invisible player whose score increases as you go. Nile: the Dice Game is fast (10 - 20 minutes), easy to learn, easy to setup and put away, and best of all... FREE!! (at least for now).",

All players can influence the speed of a car through their card play. Cards are played in tricks that are used to determine what car can move that round, how far it will move, who will drive the car, and finally what player will lead to the next trick. The track itself is far from any ordinary race track with various short cuts and back tracks scattered throughout the circuit allowing for drivers of the cars to have quite a bit of control over their progress. In the end, the player that most closely predicted the finishing order of each car will emerge victoriously. A note about how to \"short cut\" a homemade version: Use the cars from Knizia's Formula Motor Racing game and the cards from Sticheln. Using the cards from Sticheln is a real time and work saver! Granted, they won't have the cool race car look but it's a nice trade off if you have the game sitting around.",

        "description": "(from LnL website:) Fast-paced, engaging, exciting. Sound like what you\u2019ve been playing? If not, it\u2019s time to try something new, something fresh. Mark H. Walker \u2019s Lock \u2018N Load may be that something new. Lock \u2018N Load is all about fun, all about the experience. The game\u2019s impulse system keeps both players actively involved in every minute of play. The game is squad based and units represent each nationalities\u2019 squads, half-squads, weapon teams, and vehicles. The single man counters include leaders, medics, heroes, chaplains, and snipers. Each significantly affects play. And each leader and hero gets a randomly selected Skill Card before the scenario begins. These cards bestow benefits such as stealth bonuses, ambush experts, and many others. Lock 'N Load: Forgotten Heroes Vietnam is a fast moving, fun to play, tactical level game of small unit actions in the Vietnam War. While players will find it to be an accurate depiction of squad level combat you won't have to wade through a hundred pages of rules to play. In fact, you'll be up and playing after reading less than a dozen pages of rules! Scenarios Include: River of Perfume: in which U.S. Marines engage the Viet Cong in intense house-to-house fighting in the town of Hue, south of the Perfume River, on February 6, 1968. A Friend in Need: U.S. Army units move into the A Shau Valley, in May of 1969, during the opening moves of the battle that will culminate in Hamburger Hill. Two platoons advance on a small village suspected of harboring a Viet Cong contingent. The VC and the Americans know each other are in the area, but neither side expects a stand-up fight to occur. Serious Firepower: Sums up what it\u2019s about with its title. In May of 1968 the Marines spent three bloody days clearing the villages of Dai Do and Dinh To. The fighting was tough, and armor support was called on for the attack on Dai Do. The Marines had a lot of firepower, but so did the NVA forces holding the village. Undeniable Courage: depicts combat that occurred to the east of the Chu Pong Massif on November 14, 1965, between elements of the U.S. Army\u2019s Bravo Company of the 1/7 Cavalry and elements of the NVA\u2019s 320th Infantry Regiment. Shortly after they landed at Landing Zone X-ray, the Americans became heavily engaged by NVA infantry. The company commander, Lt. Herren, ordered Lt. Herrick\u2019s platoon to move up on the company\u2019s right flank. Herrick\u2019s platoon, in pursuit of an NVA squad, overshot the company and became isolated by advancing NVA troops. A big-time firefight was on. And 9 More, Nine other action-packed scenarios, all updated to comply with the V3 rules.",

Players start off as survivors of an airplane crash, they know that something is wrong but not what.  They must first leave the safety of the abandoned village and collect clues from other island locations.  Once they have collected enough clues a Horror themed Goal is revealed that usually requires gathering certain objects and bringing them to a given location (eg. To escape from the island you must take the motor from the docks and repair it in the workshop, and return with the keys and gasoline to escape). As the players move about the island they will come under attack from the Peril Deck.  The hand of cards each player holds represents the energy they have to escape from the attacks, attacks chip away at your hand (the Action Deck also represents how much daylight is left).  If you ever run out of cards in your hand after an attack you die... but the player can always return to the village to grab another survivor to wander off to find out what is going on. The game contains a few horror themed cards including \"I know what to do\", \"it's now or never\", and my favorite for twist endings \"It's not what you think\" all balanced to bring a horror movie to your tabletop in about half-an-hour. NOTE: All files necessary to play the game are located in the files section below :-)",

        "description": "Omaha Beach, June 6th, 1944. As the American troops land in Normandy, a German machine gun nest is killing them like flies... You must do something! In D-Day Dice, players are soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against the machine gun nest. Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, he will collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as his unit grows stronger and deadlier. He will succeed... or die trying. D-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive. It also includes solitaire optional rules. Although built around dice rolling, this game is about resource management (soldiers, specialists, items and courage) and knowing when to move your unit. Resources are kept from turn to turn, so the players can plan ahead (and help each other out). The Free Trial Version of the game includes 2 Battle Maps (\"Exercise Tiger\" and \"Omaha Beach\"). The commercial version will include 8 of them (and a lot more features). The commercial version of the game, coming out in March 2012, can be found HERE .",

This alone would be a little like solitaire, so enter the challenge you can make once per turn. Challenge anyone for up to three resources, and then each bid a secret amount more. Whoever has more wins everything, unless they overbid by more than three in which case the lower bid wins! This allows for player interaction, although not a high degree of such.",

        "description": "Black Death is the game of plagues for 2 to 6 players. Each player is a different strain of disease in 14th century Europe, and whoever racks up the highest body count wins. The map is based on the trade routes and major population centers of Europe at the time, the events are based on historical events, and the rules are interspersed with grim quotes from the survivors. It is a game of conquest and strategy, just a different sort of conquest than your average wargame. Component list: Black Death includes color and greyscale 15 x 20 inch maps (tiled for normal printers and single sheet for large format printers), six disease tracks, 150 counters, two player aid sheets and twenty event cards. It will take anywhere from half an hour to an hour to assemble it, depending on the work you put into it. Play notes: Black Death is unusual in that it is a kind of conquest and area control game, but your score is based on infected populations dying off, which removes your counters from play. So you are simultaneously gaining ground in one spot and choosing to lose it in another. Depending on the Virulence and Mortality of your particular strain of a disease, the strategies you can use will vary. The game can be played with 2 people, but like most games of this sort, it works best with 3 or more. Re-implements: Black Death",

Players place tiles to extend their path from a start point towards a target end point. The object of the game is to be the first player to get their path to a predetermined end point \u2013 typically a specific edge of the table, or an end point tile. Contents 4 or more Player pieces 1 or more sets of Wend tiles, each consisting of 35 Playing tiles and 1 Start/end tile Wend tiles are square in shape, and have 2 path entry/exit points on each edge. They each have four path sections which go from one path entry/exit point to another. When placed side by side, the path sections from one tile join up with those on the adjacent tile, to create meandering paths. There are 35 Wend tiles in a set, which includes one copy of all possible combinations of 4 path sections on a tile. A 36th \u2018start/end\u2019 tile is also included in a set, which is used by some games in the Wend family, including Wend-edge. This tile has 8 short path sections (used as starting or ending points), two on each edge. You will find that a single set of 35 Wend tiles is enough for a good game with 2-4 players. There is no hard and fast limit to the number of players in a game, but most players would probably want a reasonable number of tiles, and thus moves in the game. You can use extra sets of Wend tiles to accommodate more players or for a longer and more challenging game with a small number of players. Wend tile sets come with different coloured dots in each corner, so that it is easy to put tiles that have been shuffled together back into sets.",

        "description": "Taken from the publisher's website: In this heavily  armed card game, you take on the role of  a military superpower. Your mission: To  obtain 100 points worth of property. And  we're not talking property like your grandmother's 2 story house, or a Ford  Pinto with 56 thousand miles on it, we  mean Washington D.C., Moscow, and Rome to  name a few. Game play wise, don't expect to see  the \"honorable\" warfare that died off in the samurai centuries.  Now-a-days, we've got spies, blackmail,  market manipulation, terrorism, and of  course, the ever popular nuclear bomb,  which has the ability to completely  annihilate any city quicker than you can  yell \"HEY! What the?!?!\" Now THAT's a great Sunday family activity! With Global Supremacy , expect to lose  your mind\u2026 The speed of the game is  fast, so keep a clear head or you'll lose  it, along with any chances of winning the  game. Sound fun? It does to me, too! So  pick Global Supremacy up, since the price  matches all other products here at  WM\u2026 Nothing. Global Supremacy can be downloaded at whitemask.com",

        "description": "Theme: Willy Slowman was probably the best intergalactic merchant ever to tackle the business.  He started out with a hundred credits to his name and the keys to a small cargo hauler.  Over the years he forged intergalactic trade routes, stared down pirates and amassed a small fortune. When Willy died he left behind a sizeable fortune and a single stipulation in his will, that one of his relatives would prove to be the rightful heir to his shipping empire by following in his footsteps.  Relatives started pouring out of the woodwork trying for a chance to win Willy's fortune.  You know nothing about trade routes, or pirates, or the galaxy at large... but this is a chance of a lifetime.  As one of Willy's recognized relatives (fourth cousin of a nephew, twice removed) the lawyers for the Slowman estate are going to provide you with 100 credits and a small cargo hauler, if you can be the first to amass 1000 credits you will prove yourself to be the rightful heir. Gameplay: In this game the players race around the board to pick-up and deliver chits to amass their fortunes.  The board is modular in order to increase replayability, and the chits are not sorted to decrease the set-up time (chits only have to be added/removed when changing the starting worlds - not the board layout).  Chits include Events which have a timed effect, Goods, Passengers, Enemies which can harass the players or be hunted for bounty, Mined Goods and Ship Upgrades (increase your combat effectiveness or speed).  This allows for a variety of gameplay strategies.  The rules have been streamlined and every effort has been made to make it as streamlined and simple as possible without losing any of the flavor or depth. But in the end the game is all about making money, and the first player to 1000 credits is the winner.",

        "description": "From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM : MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map. To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures. As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways. MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played. The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects. Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played. Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9 See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General .",

You are one of many young pharaohs attempting to be the first to build a pyramid upon the ancient ruins of Alexandria, but first you must build upon 12 sites in the lower Nile River valley battling other pharaohs for exclusive use of construction locations. The game plays out as you place number cards in the shape of a pyramid in front of you.  Specific block locations allow for your pharaoh to be moved spaces along the path.  No pharaoh may be building in the same location which causes loss of ground and time...  Time?  Watch out for the mummies that become disturbed as the game unfolds.  They are jealous of their ancient site and allow no building upon them.  Sandstorms, thieves, and opponent sabotage await your every move.",

        "description": "Caf\u00e9 Race is a race game set in a business office. The players take the role of office workers going upstairs to the first floor to get a cup of coffee who then improvise a race while they are going back downstairs\u2026 with a cup full of coffee. The player that makes it to the bottom of the stairs and spills the least amount of coffee wins. Game summary Each round, throw as many dice as there are players. The results are the speeds at which the players may move their pawns. The players bid for these speed dice in a blind auction. Once all the speed dice have been distributed, the pawns are moved. After any movement, a check is made to see if your worker has kept his balance; if this check fails the coffee is spilled and one marker is lost. Play continues until a player crosses the end line.  The player with the most points is the winner The free print-and-play version can be downloaded from here (see the files section). The game has been professionally edited on 2006 by Homo Ludicus, a new Spanish publisher. It comes with a rule book in Spanish, Catalan, English, German and French rules.

On a Player's Turn: The current player rolls 4  6-sided dice.  If a die has your parties matching color on it it is counted as one vote for your party. (colors are included in the published version, otherwise  1-2-3 = Elephants 4-5-6 = Donkies.  With your party's votes, you may purchase state/s influence. States are influenced by Votes.  Your own parties color costs 1 vote, while your opponents color and the independent party's color (Green) cost 2 votes to influence. You may influence as many states as you can with your votes. If a state is already occupied you may influence it by paying double the cost it would normally cost you.  The only states that don't apply to these rules are the Swing States (Orange Colored states)",

        "description": "COLONY 9 is a board game for one player (a solo game) with an approximate duration of 15 minutes. You must create your colony and have it operational before the arrival of the first convoy from the planet Earth. To do this you must deploy different resources (building materials, biological, technological) in several colony buildings, as well as automate them assigning a robot if necessary. During game you will have to face several random events and build required buildings in time. For this you have different possible actions that you can choose with dice. If at the last turn, when the convoy arrives, you have built all the required buildings, you get victory points for the other buildings. The victory conditions vary depending of the colony that you are building and game difficulty. Colony 9 uses a 3x3 tile board game for building, three dice, several color cubes that represents resources (technology, biology, building materials) and several pawns that works as robots. The player can choose different actions to play from a 3x3 action chart. He throws three dice and use two of them to choose an action, and then use the other die to asign materials to a structure. To build a structure you choose an action and deploy resources in that build. The player must build mandatory structures (radio, vital systems, spaceport, etc.) before a specific turn or he'll lost the game. In addition he can build other structures (factory, control station, missile base) to gain victory points and to defend colony from alien attack or asteroids.",

Each player takes a playing piece and starts anywhere on any of the 4 edges of the board (just off the edge). You can move one space per turn. When you land on a space, you must perform the instruction on it. If you land on a space with an arrow, you must move that direction on the next turn. The object is to be the first player to the center of the board. The various spaces you land on while you move there are meant to throw the other player or players off course.

The game recreates the famous battles on Earth like Zeon's assault on Jaburo.. In additions to mobile suits (mechs), there are tanks, fighters, bombers & capital ships. It's the first game in the series which covers Zeon's assault on Jaburo base at the end of Nov U.C.0079. It's an epic tactical wargame with various types of units. Each player commands a battalion of mobile suits which have different characteristics. Some MS are good in close combat. Some are good for long-range support. Some MS can even move under water. As in the anime, there are ace pilots who may turn the tide of battle.",

The two opponents perform 6 magical gestures with their hands to cast spells - each spell created by performing a specific sequence of gestures.  As gestures for the 2 hands are written secretly, then revealed simultaneously, there is ample ground for feinting - starting a sequence leading to a certain attack, then switching to a different sequence, hoping your opponent doesn't call your bluff. The 40 different spells allow you to attack, defend, summon monsters, enchant your opponent (limit her play in different ways), and more. To win, you need to make creative use of the many options, and keep an open eye towards your opponent's schemes.  This is a game of almost pure skill. The inventor wishes to state that he has never been involved in a magical duel but would be interested to discover how realistic the game is for those who have been involved in such a bout.",

The top bidder then plays a card and everyone must follow suit if possible.  The winner of the trick takes the cards and check for dollar amounts.  This must be paid to the pot.  He then leads the next trick.  A player may fold instead of playing if he has won at least one trick with a bug.  He is out for the rest of the round and can not win the hand.  After six rounds have been played the winner of the hand is the person who has taken the fewest bugs more then zero.  Take the pot and dealer moves clockwise. Like poker there is no end of the game.

As a player you take on the role of leading one of the new financial dynasties that arose during that time, with a portfolio of investments across the continent and some influence with the Crowned Heads of Europe. You and the other players use your influence in different nations to sway the Crown into taking action that you hope will improve your fortunes or perhaps hold back your competitors. Game Components: 112 Cards 154 counters Game Board Rules You will need some 6 sided dice, preferably 4 although you can get away with just 1.

        "description": "Panzer Grenadier: The East Front is the first volume in a game series devoted to simulating combined arms platoon level combat in World War II.  Set on the Eastern Front and starting with June 22nd, 1941, this game covers platoon actions during the first few months of the German invasion of Soviet Russia. The game is of moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. Rules emphasize Opportunity and Combined Fire (plus friendly fire), Mobile Assault, Leadership, Morale, and Spotting. Special rules for Digging In, Entrenchments, Hidden Units, Minefields, and Bunkers. Special unit types include Headquarters, Aircraft, Armored Trains, Cavalry, and River Vessels. There are optional rules for Consolidation, Excess Initiative, Random Events, and Strategic Movement. Units represent the various mechanized (3-5 tracked vehicles), motorized & towed (3-5 trucks,16-28 men, and 2-4 weapons), foot platoons (15-40 men), and individual field commanders (Corporal to Lt. Colonel) that were on the Eastern Front. A wide variety of MG, Heavy weapons, AT, AA, and other combat units are represented. Game scale: hex scale = 200 meters per hex side to side time = 15 minutes per game turn strength = platoon sized units Two six-sided dice are needed to play. It's an exciting, fast-paced, WWII tactical game with many different type of units, and it requires a solid strategy to win. Easy to understand realistic game mechanics make it a pleasure to play. The counters and mounted geomorphic boards are splendid. Re-implemented by: Panzer Grenadier: Eastern Front",

In the game, 2-6 players will spend 60-90 minutes competing with each other to increase their social circle. They will gain valuable contacts and friends and, hopefully, find a true companion that will stick with them through thick and thin. In Suit Up, you will guide a guy or gal of your choosing along a new path with lifelong consequences. Where will you go in the city to develop your skills and resources? Which people will you influence to achieve your goals? What strange fates will befall your fellow players? With Valentine's Day only two weeks away, will you spend it alone, in a crowd of friends, or with a true friend and companion? The goal of Suit Up is to have the highest Score after 2 weeks (17 turns). Score is gained by spending resources (Strength, Smarts, Style and $avings) to influence people and gain friends. Resources are gathered by drafting actions from the game board (and city) as well as by card play.",

        "description": "18xx meets Scandinavia -- Railroads on Skis Intro from the manual: \"18Scan is an '18xx' game set in the Scandinavian peninsula of Northern Europe. It includes most of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. 18Scan is a small game, in the style of Mark Derrick\u2019s 'one-state' games 18GA and 18AL , and is intended as a change from the more robust 18xx games often played.\" From the Designer Notes: \"This is my second attempt at a 'small, short' 18xx game: the first, 18VA , has matured -- alas! -- into a solid, medium-length performer, but has become quite unsuited for a quick 'fill-in-the-cracks' session. I am hoping that 18Scan will not only prove to be a better short game, but will be sufficiently straightforward that it can also be used as an introduction to the 18xx system.  In 18Scan, I hope to bring to the table a simple game, yet with some strategic options, and a forgiving game -- unlike, say, 1830: Railways & Robber Barons . At the same time, 18Scan has a number of subsystems (Minor Companies, a merger railroad, Destinations, various categories of trains) that provide a panoply of the wide variety within the 18xx gaming space.\"",

He's so low he hasn't come up with a decent product name or slogan in months. Then one morning, in a rare-for-the-workplace personal moment near the coffee pot, Paul opens up to everyone. \"Yeah, the boss, he's saying I'm up for a promotion this month...if I can just turn out some good work. You know I've been a little off lately. But I think the therapy is helping...a little. And, uh, well, anyway, would you guys please not try so hard for the next couple weeks?\" You get the picture. The Game Get Paul That Promotion is a hilarious game where everyone tries hard to be uncreative, but not so uncreative they get fired. It's for 4-6 players, Ages 12 and up .",

Each player creates a surfer and a custom board, and races to the finish line, braving dangerous obstacles, at great heights and great speeds through one of 2000AD\u2019s Mega-Cities. Four \u201cSupersurfs\u201d have been depicted in the pages of 2000AD. Marlon \u201cChopper\u201d Shakespeare won Supersurf 7, held illegally in Mega-City One. Supersurf 10, held legally in Oz, was won by Jug \u201cthe Wizard of Oz\u201d Mackenzie, winner of the undocumented Supersurfs 8 and 9. Supersurf 11, a blood sport in Mega-City Two, was won by Chopper, as was Supersurf 13, back in Mega-City Two \u2013 then being rebuilt as a new Sino-City, and without the bloodbath. In Supersurf, surfers are represented by attributes such as Guts, Skill, and Form, which are required to bypass the many obstacles placed throughout the course. The course is  created semi-cooperatively by the players out of straightaway and obstacle tiles and differs each game. Attributes can decrease as a result of injuries, and must be managed like resources. Obstacles of varying types and difficulty levels present different challenges, and players have the options of setting speeds, bumping and jockeying for position, resting and recuperating, flying cautiously or flat-out. With wipe-outs always around the corner, no player is ever out of the game until after the final sprint for the finish line.",

Cards are played secretly face down then 3 movement dice are rolled for Richard.  After he moves all cards are revealed. Crowd cards played will attract between 2 and 5 people (with each stage having a different maximum allowed to gather, from 15 to 30) unless Richard is present.  If Richard is present you lose points. Finale cards convert your audience to points and then you will have to find another stage unless Richard is present.  If Richard is present you lose your audience and have to find another stage. Bump cards allow you to bump any pawn that has just moved another 3 spaces including Richard. Huzzah! cards will chase away audience members away but if Richard is present will net you a lot of points. First player to 50 points wins.",

The goal is to help Noah to complete the ark & collect as many animals & food as you can before the flood come. In each turn, a player assigns three workers to collect resources to build ark or gather animals. Beware! There are Nephilim everywhere who may kidnap your workers & raid your camp. Players may also assign workers to build up walls vs Nephilim attacks or research metal-working skill to get more resources. Besides, workers may be assigned to vineyard to produce wines. In each turn, Noah will make a worship to God & gets a blessing card. Players may use wines to bid this blessing card & control Noah. Player controlling Noah always moves first in each phase & may use Noah to get a privilege. Player who got most animal pairs at game end (when flood comes) wins.",

Game Summary You start the game with a credit of $10 and your aim is to earn enough money throughout the game to pay back this loan when the game ends. You will take turns moving your Spaceship on cards laid out as a chart of the Milky Way Galaxy, discovering new Planets as you go. You will throw dice to determine what goods will be on offer at each planet. Available goods will vary from turn to turn, so buy low and sell high while the market is friendly to you. But if luck abandons you, you may be driven to Bankruptcy by greedy Pirates and zealous Customs controls (if you dare to smuggle any illegal goods). The game ends when you turn over the last unexplored card on the Galactic Chart, or when you run out of money.

The contents of the game include: the RULES Folder(8)-pages; a thick paper CHART; a Sheet of adhesive backed counters(over 150); & a (4)-COLOR 11\" by 17\" thick paper Mapsheet; while players will need to provide their OWN 6-sided DIE. The RULES contain the following sections of note: Off-board Movement; Artillery; I.J.N. Naval Units; U.S. Engineers; Airstrip Capacity; Air Units; Brief Historical Commentary; Counters mounting advice; & the Turn Sequence on the back page. The Counters are RED/WHITE(Japanese)& BLUE/WHITE(U.S.) which are Battalion level for ground units, Air Unit Squadrons, individual Ships(Destroyers), Damaged & Destroyed Airfield markers, & Off-board Movement markers. There are MANY different Combat Unit types as well as various Aircraft depicted in this although for game purposes, these are of either Fighter or Bomber types(and F4F-Wildcats can be considered as either). The Game Chart is printed with the Setup-/Reinforcements-/Combat Results Explanations on one side with a Units-/Terrain Identification Charts on the reverse. Players may want to copy this prior to play for EACH player to have available. The game Mapsheet covers the area around Henderson Field and it's environs. Also on the Mapsheet are: the seperate Japanese & American Attack Tables; Terrain Movement Cost/Defense Modifiers Table; Off-board Movement Boxes; Reinforcements Starting locations; and BOXES for I.J.A.F. & I.J.N. - Reserve & Attack; and U.S.A.F. Reserve, C.A.P., & Ground Attack. The Turn Sequence is as follows: 1.Japanese Reinforcement phase; 2.Japan. Movement phase; 3.Japan. Combat phase; 4.Japan. Supply Resolution phase; 5.Japan. Strategic phase; 6., 7., 8.,-U.S.Player's similar to Japanese 1st 3-phases; 9.U.S. Engineer phase; 10.U.S. Air phase; 11.Check Victory Conditions or begin NEW turn. Overall, a very professional appearing production considering it's subject matter & their operating strictures while the graphics are very detailed, especially for the Aircraft types depicted. Subsequently republished after major development in Strategy & Tactics magazine #178 by Decision Games . The original AHIKS version is now available for free download.",

        "description": "Unit\u00e0 di Soccorso Giapponesi (Japanese Rescue Teams) is a cooperative game portraying the aim of the Japanese Rescue Teams to save and protect the Japanese population from the dangers which can occur in the Japanese cities, like earthquakes, typhoons, tsunamis and nuclear pollution. This game  is in memory of all the people died during the March 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami. Each player represent a Japanese Rescue Team and will try to solve the problems ariring in the Japaed on the map. The objective of the players is to reach the level 8 of the Level of Saved Lifes Track (LSL) depicted on the map, which means having saved most of the affected population and thus avoiding to reach the level -7, which would mean the loss of too many lives. Each player chooses its set of Japanese Rescue Teams (JRT) and deploy the Team 1 in a city on the map. All the Problem Tiles are put in a cup and shuffled together. The Sequence of play is like the following: The playing player rolls the d12 die: if the result is 1-6 a new Problem arises (go to c); if the result is 7-12, no new Problems! (go to e.) c. Roll the d12 die to see in which city the Problem occur (each city has a name and a reference number) d. Take one Problem Tile form the cup, see which kind of problem is shown and put it near the city rolled during c. e. Every Player can move his/her JRT in any city shown in the map, normally where there is a Problem or Ruins; there he/she tries to solve a Problem, starting from the playing Player. A JRT can try to solve one Problem per turn, so if there is more than one Problem Tile in a city, the playing Player must choose which one will be tried by his/her JRT. If the JRT manages to resolve the Problem, raise by 1 level the LSL Track, turn the Problem tile on the Ruins side. If the JRT does not manage to solve the Problem, the Problem remains and at the start of the next turn, will decrease the LSL: The players have to clear Ruins in order to avoid negative DRM in solving the Problems. A nice small cooperative game!",

        "description": "Introduction Calculae is a card game involving basic arithmetic. Players use cards to form math expressions that evaluate to a desired result. It is an educational and fun game for people who want to improve and exercise their arithmetic skills. Number of players 1 - 4 Setup Deal 5 Poker cards to each player. Place the rest of the Poker cards face-down in a Poker draw pile, the Operator cards face-up in the middle of the table, and the Result cards face-down in a Result draw pile. Multi-player Game Play (2-4 players) During the start of each round, put the top card from the Result draw pile on the table face-up in a Result discard pile. Each player then selects 2 or more Poker cards in his hand such that using these cards and at least 1 Operator card, he is able to form a math expression that evaluates to the number on the face-up Result card. Jokers can represent any number from 1 to 13. All players put their selected Poker cards in front of them face-down. If a player thinks he is unable to form any correct math expression with his current hand, he has to place all his 5 Poker cards face-down. Once all players have done this, each player reveals his selected Poker cards and take turns to form the expressions with the Operator cards. If the player forms the expression correctly, then he places his Poker cards face-down in front of him in his Score pile. For the player who is unable to form any expression and has placed his 5 Poker cards on the table, he will reveal his cards and other players have a chance to form an expression. Any of the other players may shout \u201cCalculae!\u201d and then start to form an expression. If the expression is formed correctly, he gets to keep the Poker cards used in his Score pile. If a player makes an attempt to form an expression, either using his Poker cards or other player\u2019s Poker cards, and is unable to do so or forms an incorrect expression, he will have to discard 3 cards from his Score pile to the Poker discard pile face-up. Once all players have verified their expressions formed, they draw Poker hands to fill their hand to 5 and the next round starts where a new Result card is revealed. The new Result card is placed on top of the current Result card. Continue playing until either the Poker draw pile or the Result draw pile runs out. The winner is the player with the highest Score. Solitaire Game Play (1 player) All the rules are the same, except that the player has to discard all his cards at the end of a round, whether he has formed an expression or not. Then he draws 5 new Poker cards for the next round. The aim is to score the highest Score.",

        "description": "Astromachia is a starship combat simulation boardgame for two or more players. Normally, each player controls one ship, but experienced players should be able to fly three or four ships without too much difficulty. Astromachia is distinguished from other games in this genre by three features: fast, highly interactive play; realistic Newtonian movement; and a strong sense of three-dimensionality. Players alternate taking very simple actions, such as maneuvering, angling shields, or firing a weapon. This prevents long waits for a chance to do something. Movement follows Newton's laws of motion. A ship doesn't always move in the direction it is facing. Furthermore, if a ship gets going too fast in one direction, it has to turn around and fire its engines to slow down. Astromachia is fully three-dimensional. Ships can fly at different altitudes, and can move up or down as easily as moving north, south, east, or west. (These directions are with reference to the local star system, not to a planet.) A ship can have any of 24 different orientations, and is damaged differently depending on whether the damage is coming from the fore, aft, port, starboard, dorsal, or ventral side.",

It would be a dangerous and unprecedented project \u2013 never before had oil drilling taken place so far from land. But the size of the deposits, and the vast demand from an oil-dependent and increasingly weak U.S. economy, made the hidden riches irresistible. The United States government, brushing aside international objections that the drilling would take place in neutral waters, staked its claim and sent out a task force of tankers loaded with the equipment to build an oil rig the size of a city. They found a city already there. Divers and probes reported a sprawling, domed metropolis on the ocean floor, directly above the oil deposits. Glittering palaces of gold and streets of seashells filled with men and women who breathed variously air and water, and wore rich, colourful robes. Carefully tended farms of kelp and other sea life stretching for miles. Either these people \u2013 quickly dubbed \u201cAtlanteans\u201d by a not-very-imaginative world press, despite the location of their city \u2013 were oblivious to the oil deposits just below them, or they were already tapping into them. Attempts to communicate with the Atlanteans failed \u2013 they spoke a language unknown on any continent. Linguists and anthropologists chafed to study them, but the United States government had other priorities. Learning their language would take years and would only be a prelude to negotiations that might take even longer and still go nowhere. Drilling was to begin immediately in the kelp farms outside the city dome. Negotiations and studies could take place once the oil was secured. Naval forces arrived on the scene to herd the surprised farmers behind the walls of their city while underwater engineers began construction of the foundation for the rig. The communications of the Atlanteans, increasingly insistent, could not be translated, and so were ignored. Eventually, the Atlanteans attacked. Riding giant seahorses and wielding strange weapons, supported by schools of sharks, dolphins, and other sea life, the Atlanteans drove the divers off their lands in brief, bloody raids. The President wasted no time. An act of aggression had been committed against American citizens in American-held waters. It was war. A nuclear submarine would breach the walls of the city and frogmen would secure drilling positions. Forces marshaled \u2013 and struck. This game simulates the battle between the United States navy and the forces of the so-called city of Atlantis. The navy has the advantages of overwhelming firepower and ranged weapons, Atlantis of speed and the ability to use the environment. The navy player\u2019s objective is to break through the walls of Atlantis and occupy the city, a military victory that would allow drilling to commence. The Atlantis player\u2019s objective is to destroy the nuclear submarine, repelling the navy\u2019s first attack and granting them time to summon an army of sea creatures too vast even for the modern military power of the United States to overcome.",

If this game existed 600 years ago I bet you it would have been a real hit on the Mexican High Plateau. In the deep Mexican Country The Human live surrounded by animals. The Monkeys (Ozomatli), the Lizards (Cuetzpallin) and the Birds (Quetzalli) try to settle close to Him to find food and entertainment. Unfortunately The Human will not be able to take care of all the animals at the same time. Which one of the three species will succeed in settling with the human : the mischievous Monkeys, the silent Lizards or the musician Birds? In this game, players will be part of this legend by taking over the Animals' destinies and plan their settlement next to The Human.",

As with all things in the universe, the Dragon Currents mirror the five elements of the Wu Xing: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. Players represent powerful Geomancers attempting to harness the five energetic attributes of the Dragon Currents in such a way as to bring harmony to the land. Dragon Currents is a strategy game for two players, in which players place two-sided energy tokens on Dragon Current lines.  Based on the relationship of the Wu Xing, elements either enhance or diminish other elements.  Well placed tokens can increase the player's score while decreasing his opponents.  The player who best harnesses the relationship of the energies wins.",

An important part of gameplay is the construction of buildings (common and special buildings, 26 total). Due to these constructions players can multiply their wealth and / or fame, along with the development of the army. The game is divided into various stages. In the era of \"Kingdoms Rising\" players gradually get bonuses specific to the kingdom. In the era of the \"End of Times\" all events are resolved. These two steps constitute the main part of the game, when the players give a variety of orders and fight. In the era of \"Destiny\" victory points and fines are scored. The dice are not used during the battles, so the game is not that much random ;) The game has low downtime and relatively short playing time (30 minutes per player).",

The board depicts 16 stations connected by rail lines.  On the delivery stations (beige), one of each of the eight destination tiles are placed randomly, face up.  On each of the pick-up stations (green), two passenger/freight tiles are placed randomly, face down.  Players roll a die to move (and sometimes advance the sun along its path in the sky).  As trains arrive at a pick-up station, players reveal the goods/passengers.  Sometimes, the player will load them onto their cars (limited number of cars on each train).  Sometimes, they will leave them for other players to pick up.  A player can even take a passenger part-way and leave them for another train to complete the job later. The idea is to work together to see how many jobs will be completed before the game ends.",

You\u2019re racing against your opponents to transform freshly-summoned monsters into mouth-watering dishes. Be strong, don\u2019t freak out, and remember the cook-off\u2019s motto: Eat Cthulhu before Cthulhu eats you! About A game for 2-5 chefs who aim to have the most delectable Cthulhu Mythos themed dishes in your Serving Area at the end of the game. What you need \u2022    A bunch of 6-side dice. About 12 will do. (Don't eat them they are not a tasty snacks) \u2022    Assorted tokens. Beads, counters, or ancient artefacts from Ry\u2019leh will do. \u2022    A deck of Cthulinaria cards.

What a nuisance, they never follow orders and many times they just mess things up. They are like that annoying person at the Miskatonic University that would follow you around all day pretending to be your friend and trying to help but really they are clueless, but in a way you feel sorry for them. Bring Assistants into your game and watch them create havoc, rather than food. Sometimes you can even hear The Great Cthulhu moaning about them.

        "description": "Levy. Maneuver. Conquer. The Duke is a dynamic, tile-based strategy game with an old-world, feudal theme, high-quality wooden playing pieces, and an innovative game mechanism in its double-sided tiles. Each side represents a different posture \u2013 often considered to be defensive or offensive \u2013 and demonstrates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or after the use of a special ability), the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive posture. Each posture conveys different options for maneuver and attack. The full circle is a standard Move, the hollow circle the Jump, the arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on. Each turn a player may select any tile to maneuver, attempting to defend his own troops while positioning himself to capture his opponent's tiles. If you end your movement in a square occupied by an opponent's tile, you capture that tile. Capture your opponent's Duke to win! Players start the game by placing their Duke in one of the two middle squares on their side of the game board. Two Footman are then placed next to the Duke. Each turn a player may choose to either move a single tile or randomly draw a new tile from the bag. With twelve different Troop Tiles, all double-sided, and sixteen total pieces for each player, the variety of game play is limitless. Beyond the endless variety of the basic game, Terrain Tiles introduce a variety of game play options, altering the game board. These rules also include several alternate objectives, such as the challenging Dark Rider game which pits five Pikeman against a lone Knight.",

        "description": "If you are interested in filler games, or portable boardgames to bring along on travel trips, then the Rainbow Deck is for you! It is basically a 100-games-in-1 cardgame system. The Rainbow Deck (RD) is a cardgame system that has a total of 162 cards. There are 12 suits with each suit having 13 ranks, and 6 Joker cards. The suits are represented by both colour and number. The ranks are from 0 to 9, J to K. The cards also numbered from 0 to 119, and have letters from A to Z. The RD can be adapted to play a variety of games, just like a deck of Poker cards. The difference is that the RD has 8 more suits, numbers from 0 to 119 as well as alphabet letters, thus it is most suitable for playing abstract games that require numbers, colours or letters. It can also be used by game designers as components in their own prototype games. Players can also combine the RD with other boardgames with components having colours, numbers or letters to form new games! The RD can be complemented by 6 colours x 27 chips, 6 coloured dice and 6 coloured pawns/meeples. This allows playing of cardgames that require chips, dice or pawns. The chips can be marked using permanent markers with the corresponding values on one side. Also, the cardbacks have a 2x3 checkerboard pattern and they can be used to form boards which, together with the chips and pawns, can be used to play a variety of abstract games. Decks that the RD can be mapped into - Sequence of numbers of 0 to 119 - Letters with values similar to Letter Head - 12 suits (colour/number) x 1-13 values - 6 suits (icon) x 1-23 values (2x10+3) - 6 suits (icon) x 2 copies of 1-13 values - 12 suits (colour/number) x 2 copies of 1-6 dice values - 6 suits (icon) x 4 copies of 1-6 dice values - 6 suits (icon) x 26 letter cards - n * 26 letter cards + rare letter cards Rainbow Deck - Reinventing the playing cards!",

They want nothing more than to show the C.A.T. to be an inferior model by beating it at it\u2019s own game. Things can get pretty heated in this struggle for dominance, and it\u2019s not unheard of for a C.A.T. or Mouseoid to upgrade it\u2019s technology to laser guns or rocket launcher's to be numero uno. The game consists of 2 - 4 players (4 being best) racing around a board depicting the future home as either the C.A.T. or Mouseoid. Players race to active portals which will upgrade weaponry, give better wheel systems and also locate precious objects that will win them the game as they are returned to the master room.

        "description": "This 2-player game simulates the great public debate over the ratification of the Constitution that took place across the United States from 1787-1789.  The game employs the popular card-driven mechanics of such well-known games as Twilight Struggle and 1960: The Making of the President . Representing the Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the players pursue strategies to ratify or defeat the Constitution.  The Federalists win if nine states ratifiy the Constitution.  The Anti-Federalists win if five states refuse to ratify. The game places a premium on hand management and strategic planning by providing players with the tools to build powerful hands of cards over consecutive turns.  After players become familiar with the deck of cards, playing time should be around 2 hours.",

You tell them of your plan to write a hit sci-fi story and suddenly it catches fire! You rush home to your flat in an inspired haze and start writing that million-dollar story: The one about a bunch of Martians and a time machine. One week later, you return to the pub buzzing with excitement. Just as you are about to fill them in, Susie arrives boasting about her new tale, \u201cDoomsday: The Martian Shrink Ray.\u201d Moments later, Frank counters with a different story: \u201cThe Robot Toxin.\u201d It would seem that your friends have all got the same idea. Happily, you laugh through the night comparing, modifying and sharing ideas. As Steve pours another round, a friendly wager arises: Who can write the best science fiction story in five weeks time? Looking down at your beer-stained draft, you toss twenty-dollars into the pot. This one\u2019s in the bag, your pals don\u2019t stand a chance. . . This is a game of draft building. Each turn, players will add and subtract cards from a shared deck. Then, players will draft cards from this deck. After players have chosen a set of cards, they will take turns playing them. In a turn, players can choose to either discard cards (in order to save ink), or to spend ink to play cards (developing plot-lines). The plots players develop will then influence the next weeks workshop, as they help players to add and remove cards from the shared deck.",

Playing units in this manner costs \"Shield Points\" (which go into a kitty obtained by the player who deploys all his units first) and despite the light theme of combat between units, the game is actually won by the player who has the most shield points at the end (thus being the most resourceful).

There are 3 different kind of Stars (4, 5 or 6 branches). Each player has his own secret goal telling the shape of the Constellation he must realize on the board. To be valid, a Constellation must be made of only 1 type of Stars, and must include the Moon tile. The winner is the first player who has his own Constellation appears on the board. The Gamers Constellation uses the same game mechanics as Xochintlan and 6x5. This game is available for free download on the author's website. Note from the author: After having inserted this game in the BGG database, I realized there's another game named Constellation, from Hans van Halteren and published in 2003. The two games look very similar in many aspects... This is only pure coincidence ! Mine is derived from the original \"Fountain of the King\" that I originally designed in 1995, which transformed into Xochintlan, then 6x5, and now the Gamers Constellation. I thought this was a great and original idea ... well, my bad !",

        "description": "Concordia, res parvae crescunt. Discordia, maximae dilabuntur. In Concord, smaller things grow. In Discord, greater things decay. Vera Discordia is a fantasy warfare print&play cardgame for 2 players licensed with a Creative Commons (Attribution-NonCommercial-NonDerivative). It will be first published in Spanish, followed by an English translation. Behind this project there's a team of 7 illustrators, 2 graphic artists, a dozen of playtesters and a designer/coordinator, all working for personal satisfaction. Vera Discordia is not collectible, but modular. Each module will bring more armies to play with, for a total of 8 different armies. Epic and multiplayer variants will also be published. Vera Discordia plays on an imaginary board, and its army decks are fixed: there is no deck building, so you'll have to prove your skills in the battlefield. Assign orders to your troops, use Terrain in your favor, Maneuver, Support, close your lines and try to break through enemy lines. Launch direct attacks, arrow salvoes or unexpected flying attacks in order to decimate the opposing forces or capture the enemy General. Vera Discordia takes place in an unique fantasy setting. Take command of the spiritual Nir and their faerical allies, the Gardarek demon-worshipping barbarians, the strict Akeyrith and their celestial cohorts, the unfathomable Shogh made of pure Darkness, the reckless Zleradainn and their bloody rituals, the wild Falkaethe and their birds of prey companions, the ancient empire of Iskelond and their refined tecnoalchemy, or the exotic Drakaethe dragonriders and their skilled assassins.

Scallywags , originally available as a print-and-play game titled Doubloons! , is a light-hearted game in which players are swashbuckling pirates divvying up their booty. To start the game, a selection of coins are dumped in the center of the table to form the loot pile. These coins are marked on only one side and are left face-up or face-down as they fall. On a player's turn, he can either take a face-down coin from the pile and add it to his stash or play one card (from three in his hand) to take face-up coins, steal from others, give coins to opponents, and more. Why would you want to give coins to others? Because once a player has ten coins, he can't receive any more \u2013 which means you want to stuff them with all the pennies while making a play for the gold yourself. Once all players have collected ten coins, the game ends and the player with the most valuable stash wins!",

        "description": "For more than a millenia, the Netherlands has been constructing polders to reclaim land from the sea. Dikes are built and wind driven drainage mills pump the seawater out, leaving new usable land behind. Players drain water to create land and then settle farms, villages and cities, and build prestige buildings. The player who best develops their polders and gains the most victory points will win the game. Polders is a 2-4 player game lasting about 30 minutes. Needed to Play: \u2022 The deck of 76 cards \u2022 1 Starting Player token to keep track of who goes first each round \u2022 1 Role pawn, 1 Score Track and 1 Score Track Marker for each player in a matching color \u2022 2 sets of 35 double sided tiles used to designate mills, farms, villages and cities (called settlements) in the game \u2022 40 to 50 other people markers in one color, preferably black. These markers are used to designate mills, farmers, villagers and merchants in the game Play: Each game round has 3 phases: Phase 1 - Role Choice Beginning with the start player, each player places their role pawn on one of the 5 double-sided Role cards, claiming 1 of the 2 roles on the card. Players can place pawns only on Role cards that do not have a pawn already on them. Phase 2 - Polder Drainage Beginning with the start player, each player, in turn, clockwise from the start player, may do only one of the following actions: a. Place a new Polder card and Mill marker in their holding b. Drain all Polders one level Phase 3 - Development Players place markers and score any victory points at this time, per role actions. Players may only place one type of settlement (Farm, Village or City) tile on any one Polder card. Players may never place a settlement tile on a card already developed as a Grist Mill. Prestige Buildings may be claimed by players who have chosen the Banker, Mayor and Merchant roles during this round. Certain Prestige Buildings, once claimed by a player, give additional bonuses to role actions: Armory: The player may place one additional merchant when choosing the Merchant role. May be to a different city. Bookshop: The player may move one additional farmer to either a village or city when choosing the Scholar role. May be from a different farm. City Gate: The player may place one additional villager when choosing the Villager role. May be in a different village. Church: The player may move one additional merchant to a village or villager to a city when claiming the Clergyman role. May be to a different village or city. Pasture: The player may place one additional farmer when choosing the Farmer role. May be to a different farm. Win: 1. Score the largest Farm by counting each player\u2019s largest number of adjacent Farm settlement tiles and multiply by 2 for the VP score. Each farmer on every Farm settlement adds additional 1VP. 2. Score 1VP for each villager on a Village settlement tile adjacent to a Grist Mill. Grist Mills may share Villages. 3. Each player scores 1VP for each City settlement tile and 1 VP for each merchant in their City settlements. 4. Subtract 1VP for each level not drained on any Polder card still showing its water side. The player with the highest VP score is the winner. In the event of a tie, the player with the single largest population of merchants in one City is the winner.",

The Dark Lords have joined forces to completely conquer and subjugate all the known Lands, and only the combined efforts of all the greatest heroes can halt their nefarious plan. 12 Realms is a fast, lighthearted cooperative miniature game for 1 to 6 players. All players must band together to stop the Dark Lords' overwhelming hordes from pillaging the 12 Realms. Individual invaders can be defeated by using each hero's different talents, but to vanquish the Dark Lords you must claim a powerful artifact. In their quest to stop the invasion, the heroes can travel together between different lands, or they can try to single-handedly defend a Realm. Each of the 12 Realms is an individual land, with different treasures and events, and populated by unique creatures.",

Intel suggests that the enemy has amassed a large force, and put them ashore outside your capital in the midst of night. Their mission? To launch nuclear missiles at your nations leader, and every monument in your capital. Our engineers have sent out a signal that interrupts the mech's connection with their home base, causing them to wander meanlessly around. Now, you must sneak out to destroy each of the enemies' mechs, before they are powered up and ready to launch.But be careful.\" Sneak Attack is a free, print-to-play game designed for the \"sneaky sci-fi game contest\".

How about seeing Genghis Kahn flying in low over the steppes to terrorize his opponents with attack helicopters?  Go into battle with some of the most feared and successful military leaders of all time.  Use the same tactics they used to win their battles.  Fight with the military forces revered throughout history.  All this is possible with the abstract wargame--Battle Leader Tactics (BLT).\" BLT is a component and introductory game for the Battles Leaders Tactics & Technology (BLTT) master game.  BLTT is an abstract wargame that depicts some of the greatest military leaders (e.g., Alexander, Napoleon, Caesar, etc.) commanding historical units in some of the world most decisive battles (e.g., Megiddo, Zama, Hastings, Waterloo, etc.) using proven tactics of history.  BLT serves as a basic game introducing players to the interaction between army units, leaders and tactics.  BLT allows players to command standard troops (e.g, infantry, cavalry, artillery and guard) and special military units (e.g., 300 Spartans, Panzer Army Afrika, etc.) with historic military leaders using real tactics and fog of war--all without any dice.  The primary resolution engine for the game is housed in the Tactics Results Chart (TRC), which compares tactics selected by the players and determines losses, if any, of army units. Components: 21 Leader Cards 24 Tactics Cards (12 for each player) 28 Army Cards (14 for each player) 10 Special Army Cards 1 Tactics Results Chart 1 Rules Booklet 1 Leader Card Explanation Sheet",

Players play cards out of their hands to move themselves closer to Draco, or to move other players farther away.  Whoever has the most money at the end of the game wins!

With the unrestrained strength of the elements on one hand, and with the help of the tender elementals on the other, a clever player will direct the outcome of the struggle of the elements and become the Master of the Elements... Each turn, players have to decide whether to increase their influence by placing an appropriate marker or to secure their square by placing a possession token. But then, there are the elementals who can't be conquered with pure strength... The player who can place all his possession tokens wins the game. This game was released as a PnP game on October 26th 2011, the author's 38th birthday. This game came in the final round (i.e. Top 12) of the Hippodice contest 2012.",

The game consists of a board, bee cards (queens and workers), pollen cards, honey cards and action cards. On a players turn they roll the dice and move that number of spaces around the board, collecting special cards as they land on the relevant spaces. These cards are used to get new bees, inflict disease on other players hives, or cure your own infected hives.",

Judicious use of slender finances to create armies, alliances and acts treachery is essential to victory. Bind other princes to you with marriage alliances to gain a breathing space to perhaps build fortifications to protect your land. Who dares truly wins in this game of big chances and big payoffs, but the winner of today could easily be the loser tomorrow..... The game can go up to twenty turns, but thanks to our variable game termination rules, the last turn could be anytime between turns 12 and 20, thus making it virtually impossible for the \"gang up on the leader\" syndrome to ruin everyones fun. One player is rarely so far ahead that they become the target of other players anyway. The players to choose from: The Empire of Constantinople The Nicean Empire The Duchy of Athens The Principality of Achaea The Despotate of Epiros The Kingdom of Thessalonika The Venetians of Crete (Lords of the Archipelago) In the Shadow of Byzantium can be played with up to seven players. A four player game takes about 2 hours to play. There is very little set up and almost no record keeping (just treasury- big deal!). We had so much fun playing this game first time out we believe it is destined to be one of our most popular products ever. It is a fast paced nail-biter where the victor is in doubt until the last turn. This is a web-published game that is free to download and play.",

Now it's time to gather your friends together, group at your nest, then head into town to party the night away. \"Unfortunately there's only one dog sled available to go into town, so the first group that's ready to leave gets to ride in style, while everyone else has to walk. To complicate matters, local drilling is causing the ice to crack and shift unpredictably. The path that you take to get to your buddies may not be there on your way home. On top of that, the Polar Bear Gang has been making life tough, so you'll have to be super-sneaky if you need to go through their territory. \"Even so, you're not going to let these obstacles stop you. You deserve a break, and you'll be darned if you're going to make the long, cold, 60-mile hike to town on flipper. Be the first one to gather your buddies up and get home again and you'll be ready for a... \" Penguin's Night Out !\" Object: To be the first player to collect all of your buddies and return home on an ever-shifting playing field. You Need: * A set of double-six dominoes. * A penguin pawn for each player. Assorted chess pieces work well. * Two buddy tokens for each player. Pocket change is a good choice. * Two six-sided dice. * Paper and pencil. You and your opponents take turns moving around the board (made up of dominoes) and altering the board. End your turn in your nest while carrying both of your buddy tokens to be the first group to get your   dog sled into town and win the game. Yippee!

Afterwards a it is rolled how many resources are ill or left the company. After the drawing of new projects the resources are allocated. At the end of the round all projects that had all required resources allocated may bring victory points. The game ends after 6 (short variant) or 12 (long variant) rounds.",

        "description": "The Twelve Doctors is an unauthorised, non-profit and non-collectable card game set within the immensely popular Doctor Who universe. Consisting of two balanced 60-card decks, the game pits two players against each other for the fate of the galaxy. One player takes the role of the Doctor in all his regenerations, and his opponent assumes control of his arch enemy, The Master. At his disposal, the Doctor has a roster of companions from his past to help struggle against the renegade Timelord, featuring Rose Tyler, Romana, Adric, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, etc. His equipment includes, amongst others, his Sonic Screwdriver, K-9, jelly babies', and the Hand of Omega. The Master has a wide selection of villainous temporal marauders to choose from: Zygons, Ood, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, Robots of Death, Omega, The Valeyard, Sutekh, and The Rani, etc. He even has the meddlesome option of starting an Interstellar War - much like he did between the Draconians and the Earth Empire in Space War. His deck also features such interesting devices as the Laser Screwdriver, Tissue Compression Eliminator, and a Raston Warrior Robot. The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. The Twelve Doctors is played using a 3-column time-line system, representing the battle for Gallifrey, Earth present and future, and Earth past. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with companions EX-TER-MI-NATED! frequently, and marauders being dropped into black holes, or destroyed by the well-placed use of Venusian Aikido. Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, The Master has 3 planets that he can atomise during the course of each game: Telos, Metebelis III, and Skaro. This is in addition to the damage he may wreak upon Earth or Logopolis, etc, through cardplay. Destroying a planet has long-term consequences for the player, as well as short-term benefits. The Doctor, on the other hand, has the Journal of Impossible Things to use, but if he does so, makes the game easier for The Master to win. Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has three values: power, cost, and disrupt. Both player's decks are also a measure of the time they have remaining to thwart each other. The Twelve Doctors lineage can be traced back to San Juan , Magic: The Gathering , BattleTech CCG , and Iliad . Victory Conditions: Whoever cannot draw a card has lost. The Master wins if he disrupts more cards than the Doctor has left in his deck. The Master wins if Gallifrey's power is reduced to zero. The Master wins if Earth's power is reduced to zero (past and future). The Master wins if all 11 incarnations of the Doctor are regenerated/destroyed. The Master wins if 5 tokens are placed upon the Wirrn. The Doctor wins if all 6 incarnations of the Master are regenerated/destroyed. The Doctor wins if 5 tokens are placed upon Lucy Saxon. Whoever gets 5 Key to Time cards in play first wins (expansion victory condition).",

        "description": "THIS GAME IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING MAJOR CHANGES. Check the development blog here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/blog/581 a game for 1 - 2 Players by Andreas Propst Once upon a time there was a kingdom covered with an endless, almost impenetrable wilderness. In the dark depths of the forests and swamps of this realm, horrible beasts and dragons lurked, often terrorizing the helpless farmers and village dwellers of the kingdom. In order to make an end to the terror and rid the country from the bestial scourge, the king summoned the bravest and most fearless heroes from all four corners of the country. He sent them on a noble quest to free the country of all dragons and foul beasts, to make the kingdom a safe place to live in. Unfathomable peril, but also treasure, gold and glory await the fearless Dragonslayers! The goal of the game: is to slay all monsters without being killed. You can either play solo or two players. If you play two players, the player who slew the most monsters in the end wins. If you play solo, you can set a high score in your first game which you can try to beat in further games by trying to beat the game in as few turns as possible while amassing a maximum of gold!",

With the rules written down for the first time, Paper Cricket is now available, for free, to everyone. Paper Cricket is a simple game that aims to provide a bit of entertainment if you\u2019re stuck as a passenger on a very boring car/train/plane journey or when you\u2019re stuck late at work with nothing but some paper, a pencil (or pen) and a dice. At its\u2019 most simple you need nothing else. Paper Cricket does NOT intend to perfectly simulate the ebb and flow of a cricket match BUT from experience it does enough to provide realistic scores, averages and statistics. Cricket, like baseball, is a game of statistics. With simple play rules (and optional squad selection mechanics) it's a game to pick up and play wherever you are and whatever you're doing.",

Over 60,000 soldiers fought in one of the bloodiest battles in the history of South America... After this battle, for the first time in history, a non-European army marched on the streets of Buenos Aires... Monte Caseros is a card game for two players whose theme is the Battle of Monte Caseros. Each player must manage their armies composed of Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery. Each player must correctly apply their strategic cards, trying to trap the enemy officers and annihilate your troops! At each turn the player must place on the battlefield cards that represent their armies and, when appropriate, to attack the enemy army, applying their strategic cards. For the resolution of the fighting we use the military force of each cards, the strategic factor, and a combat resolution table as the best war games.",

        "description": "In the World of ChessCraft, there are 4 races. Each race represented by a different colour. Orc is Red, Undead is Black, Human is Blue and Elf is Green. Each has their own unique abilities to influence the game play. Orc has piece promotion and piece destruction. Undead has graveyard manipulation and piece control. Human has piece position and board manipulation. Elf has card manipulation. The battle has just began! ChessCraft is an abstract game played with cards, for 1 vs 1 or 2 vs 2 players. Each game takes around 30 min to 1 hr. Contents of the full games are: a)    32 pieces b)    75 cards c)    16 board tiles The objectives of the game are (1) Capture the opponent king (2) Accumulate 20 or more cards per player (3) When the king reaches the opponent\u2019s summoning board tile Players take turns to place the board tiles. At the beginning of each player's turn, he draws 1 card from a common draw pile. During his turn, the player has to make a move on one of his pieces. At any time during his turn, he can (1) Summon basic or advanced pieces (2) Promote basic pieces to advanced pieces (3) Play cards To do these 3 actions, costs must be paid first, which means discarding cards equal to the cost face down to a common discard pile. Whenever a card is played, the opponent may respond by playing a card. Cards are resolved first in last out. During opponent's turn, player may also play cards. Player can also modify the movement, capture or interaction with opposing piece of a piece in play by paying the cost of a Piece Modifier Action card. The effects of the modification lasts only the turn the card is played. Unsummoned pieces are in each player\u2019s reserve. When the pieces are captured (or destroyed), they are placed in each player\u2019s graveyard. There are 2 types of cards. Actions go to the discard pile face up immediately while Permanents stay in play in front of the player who played them. Kings cannot be targeted or affected by cards unless specified. Player may not Check the opponent if he plays any card prior to his Move. Each 2x2 board tile has a coloured circle in one of the squares. The circle indicates the square as a terrain of that colour. At the beginning of a player\u2019s turn, if his pieces occupy all 4 terrains of his own colour, he can draw 1 more card.

The two armies met at Lobositz. Postcard game using one sheet for the map, few counters and easy rules. With additional scenario and optional rules. A Must Have ! Suitable in solitary play.",

Station tiles that show a commodity they will accept, country tiles, that have commodities printed on them and track tiles to connect the stations.  On their go, each play will place a new tile and move their locomotive. They will then check to see if their locomotive connects a station that provides a  commodity to a station that can receive that commodity.  If they have achieved this, that player will collect the income that connection generates. They may then also have to pay tax to the manager of any of the sidings involved.  Loads are then placed on the delivery station to show no more of that commodity is needed.  These are removed as the game play proceeds.  At the end of the game,  the winner is the player  with the most money. The game is free to download, print and play.",

The game can be played as a solitaire puzzle or competitively. Each player has a hand of tiles they must play optimally to keep a flow of new tiles coming in and if possible keep aside some tiles in a supply stack that will be worth more points at the end of the game. Drawing new tiles is done by activating catalysts, this part is very tactical. During the game, groups of micropul of the same color will get formed. These groups can be claimed and will be worth a lot of points if they are closed at the end of the game. This is the strategic part. Winning is done by balancing the tactical and strategic part.

        "description": "A (very) quick playing real-time rummy style game the aim in Pest Control is to clear your hand of pests (cards) before the other players. Players have a hand of 7 cards, which they play down by making nests (melds) of 3 or more cards either of the same type or in sequential order, i.e. a run. Cards may also be added to nests played by any player. On their turn players either pick up a card off the draw deck or the entire discard pile, they then discard a card. However cards may be played down by any player at any time during their turn or other players turns,in other words the game can end at any point, meaning you have to keep a close eye on what the other players are doing and how many cards they have left. Cards left in the hand score negative points, the person with the lowest points at the end of the game is the winner. Pest Control is a print & play game which can be tried out first with an ordinary pack of cards if you are only playing 2-4 players. The decks can be easily printed at Artscow: Pest Control Creepies Deck http://www.artscow.com/share/r9a406xevpm3 Pest Control Creepies Deck Crawlies Deck http://www.artscow.com/share/7ys9l128kc5s If you are only planning on playing 2-4 players you can print and play with either deck, if you plan on playing with 5-8 players you will need both.",

You only know 5 Chinese characters, one for each meal type (beef, chicken, lamb, fish and vegetables). For each meal type, you are hesitating between two Chinese characters. You will have to try to order using your very limited knowledge of the language. The waiter, slightly confused, will bring you what he thinks the majority wants. The player who successfully orders the most meals will score the most points and win. The players will do this by predicting which meal type is the most abundant in a common pile of Meal cards. To help them, they will be able to add Meal cards to the pile. However, the more cards they add to the pile, the less prediction they will be allowed to make. To win, a player will have to balance memory, risk-taking and bluffing. The game is made of 110 cards.",

All games in the Game-o-gram series should fit on a postcard and should preferably contain everything needed to play. The basic idea of the game is that it should be cheap enough for everyone to buy, easy enough for everyone to play and interesting enough to play over again. Space Dogfight is a rapid two-player game where the players will challenge each other in a brutal and ultimate space duel, using custom-made fleets of space ships. This game is not only available as a postcard game, but also as a free print-n-play game! The print-n-play document (PDF) is downloadable in the Files section below, and it contains the same things found on the postcard, i.e. game board, counters and rules.",

        "description": "From the publishers website: Death Angel . An Oscar winning game if there ever was one. Basically, you and the other players are stuck in an abandoned farming community, hunted by a psychotic 21 year old with 10\" metal blades bolted through her fingers. The game play is very gory, the odds are in Angel's favor, and you must often fight with weapons no better than a flashlight. (Or a rake if you get really lucky..) However, that's the fun of the game! You see, the point of Death Angel isn't really to \"win\", but to survive. Face it; Angel is better. She can appear and disappear at will, she's always got a deadly weapon, and worse of all, she regenerates almost instantly. Lucky for you, she does play fair; if you out run her, she might leave you alone. If you do something silly like jump through a window, she'll go away. (If you survive the fall, you can rejoice!) If you hit her too hard, she'll disappear. (Of course, next time you see her, she's going to be pretty peeved at you.) And finally, if you survive until 5AM, she'll allow you to continue your life in peace. And so, the primary goal is not to defeat Angel, but to survive her wrath. I wouldn't bet money on surviving all 6 hours, though. Expect to lose 2, maybe 3 victims before daybreak...",

Object: To push high-scoring pieces off the board and add them to your treasure chest. You Need: A chessboard. One stash of Icehouse Pieces for each player. No stash may have the same color as another stash. On your turn, place a piece from your stash in a vacant space on the board. If there are any pieces in adjacent spaces (including diagonals), move them one space directly away from the piece you placed. You\u2019ve just slammed a major impact onto the board, and it scattered nearby pieces. If a moving piece attempts to enter an occupied space, allow it to, and push the occupying piece into the space beyond; this may cause entire rows of pieces to move. If a piece attempts to leave the board, place it in your treasure chest \u2014 unless it\u2019s your color. If it\u2019s your color, put it in your stash. Once all pieces have been relocated, your turn ends. Play passes to the left. Winning: Each piece has a point value equal to the number of pips on it (1, 2, or 3). Tally the points in your treasure chest and your stash. If your score is the highest, you win.",

The aging knight bent over, panting heavily, and gave his dwarven peer an approving nod. It had taken great effort between them both to slay the beast, and they had each taken their share of wounds. But in the end their cooperation had paid off and they both knew it. And then their eyes found the treasure chest sitting in the corner of the room. They looked at each other. They looked back at the treasure... and then the real fight began. The game where YOU are the final boss! Dungeon Run is an exciting dash through a dungeon packed with monsters and traps. Each player controls a unique hero capable of great feats, and whose powers and abilities are upgradable and customizable throughout the game. Players can work together to overcome the perils of the dungeon, or they can betray and sabotage each other as they see fit. Because in the final room of the dungeon lurks a powerful boss with the ultimate treasure - a treasure that turns its owner into the most powerful warrior they can become! Slay the boss, steal the treasure, and then run for your life as your friends try to cut you down.  In Dungeon Run only one hero can escape with the fabled Summoning Stone. Don't crawl - run! Dungeon Run features a randomly assembled dungeon that changes each time you play, as do the monsters you face and the treasures you find. Eight different heroes each with unique options for customization further add to a wealth of game play options. Choose the vicious Tundra Orc and bash your way through everything that stands in your path. Play as the cunning Grounder Wizard and use your magic to cheat the laws of nature. Select the Guild Dwarf adventurer and lay traps to ensnare your friends. There are many paths to victory in Dungeon Run. Win by working with your friends or against them - just win!",

        "description": "Road Cycling Tour (RCT) is a road cycling simulation focusing on team tactics in multi-stage races. By means of road/track tiles stages can be built to simulate real or imaginary cycling events. Movement is modified roll-and-move with some additional rules for breakaways and closing gaps (as a simulation of slipstreaming). The characteristics or qualities of the cyclists/riders are represented with 'speed counters' that can be used to replace or in addition to the dice. Teams should generally have a balanced mix of riders with different specializations represented by different sets of speed counters. A 'beginners' game' and rules for time trials, team time trials, and some advanced and optional rules are included with the game, but given the flexible nature of the game, players can easily make further adaptations to simulate their favorite cycling event. To further explain the most complex rules, a series of picture tutorials can be found in the 'rules forum' here. RCT is not a short game. It is recommended to play at least 5 stages in a single game, and with 2 experienced players, that would take between 2 and 3 hours. More players and more (and/or longer) stages make the game longer, smaller teams make it shorter but have a negative effect on possible team tactics. However, RCT is played stage by stage, and it would be easy to play different stages on different occasions. The game is a free download. All necessary files are available in the files section here.

        "description": "Modern Naval Battles is a novel card game for two to six players, based on present day sea power. The games is played in \"rounds,\" with players taking turns to maneuver the ships in their fleets, attack opponent\u2019s ships, and defend their own fleet against enemy attack. At the end of each round, players receive points for each enemy vessel they have sunk. The game can end when a player achieves a specific point total, or when all opposing fleets are sunk. The game is of medium complexity. There are two expansion sets, Modern Naval Battles II: The Campaign Game and Modern Naval Battles III . The one major issue with the game is the lack of weapon cards (torpedoes) available for the submarines. Expanded by: Modern Naval Battles II: The Campaign Game Modern Naval Battles III This game has been revised and renamed as Cold War Naval Battles and re-released (by the designers) in PDF format (free for personal, non-commercial use).  The PDF files are available from http://www.relativerange.com/Relative_Range/Cold_War_Naval_Battles.html The revised re-released game consists of six modules: Cold War Naval Battles (CWNB) CWNB II Action! CWNB III: Reinforcements! CWNB IV: The Air Module CWNB V: The Campaign Game CWNB VI: Sister Ships Printed sets can also be purchased from the Relative Range site. The re-release of the expanded game system, under a new name, probably deserves a separate entry into the BGG database. A simpler version with a SciFi-theme is Star Force Terra #1: Contact!",

You have even picked out a couple of comfy spots where the grass is a bit longer. Perhaps after lunch you might take a little nap. It's great being a dog! Now imagine there is another dog sniffing about on your lawn. It looks like this other dog might want to muscle in on your territory. Oh No! Now it has sat down in one of your comfy spots! This is war. But how on earth could you, a humble dog, show the intruder that this lawn is yours, and yours alone? Take control of the lawn by weeing in strategic positions. Use your wee to claim ownership of bones, sausages and comfy spots, and ensure that in the end you dominate the lawn, so the other dog will clear off.",

Even though forced to find a new home on the ocean ground, nothing stopped humans to continue battling each other. You are a mercenary trying to make his living by serving those that pay most. Your mission sounds easy at first glance: Scout the ocean ground for three different resources and bring them back to the hangar, so the technicans can build a bomb you are to drop over the enemy base. Here comes the downside: You are all on your own between the beasts of the deep sea as well as the very well armed hostile submarines. And the resources to equip your sub are limited! Good luck, mercenary - we count on you. Schleichfahrt - sneaking behind enemy lines has been created during the Sneaky Sci Fi Game Contest in May/June 2010 held by Rudolf Aligierski. It is a solitaire ocean crawl in which you are playing a mercenary in his sub on his mission to gather resources and - upon having done so - to deploy a bomb on the hostile base. While you will encounter monsters of the deep sea as well as loads of hostile subs, fighting is not always an option. Most of the time you will be better off relying on your engines to maneuver you out of sight of the enemy subs.",

You'll need - the deck of 54 Ragnar\u00f6k cards, 9d6 and 5 eurocube markers per player One player will be the Aesir Norse Gods and will battle, in a series of realms, against the J\u00f6tunn Frost Giants played by the other player for the fate of the world. To win the game a player must win total 5 battles in the 9 Realms (These do not have to be consecutive wins). A battle takes place in each Realm. Each player will use Strength, Wisdom, and Cunning in their battle, vying to have the most powerful attack. A Strength card (Frost Giant of Norse God) is played first, followed by 2 cards from your hand (Wisdom) allowing you to roll a number of dice to add to your Strength. Lastly another card is played (Cunning) allowing modifications to the dice rolls. Strategy involves knowing the right card to play when because some cards will give you bonuses depending on the Realm they are played in. Game files include both a low ink grayscale and full color card set, rules and tuckbox artwork. An Artscow version is also available for order.",

One player controls the evil and sentient Overlook hotel, the other the Torrence family, winter caretakers of the haunted estate. Using ambient hedge animals, terrifying phantoms and possibly human possession, the hotel tried to claim young, psychically gifted Danny as it's own - by killing him. But Danny and his family will not go gentle into the dark night. This game was designed with the knowledge and assistance of Stephen King, who was one of the first play-testers. It is available for free download at http://micro.brainiac.com/contest-games.html . Winner of the first Microgame Design Contest, in 1998.",

        "description": "Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game. The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game. The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines). Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.",

        "description": "Wings of Lightning is a solitaire gamebook that was submitted to the 2012 Solitaire Print and Play contest .  Out of the 49 games submitted, Wings of Lightning won 8th place overall.  It also won the Best Paragraph Game and Best Large Game categories and was first runner-up for Best Sci Fi/Fantasy Game. Unlike most gamebooks, Wings of Lightning eschews dice in favor of a system based on poker cards.  The combat system seeks to emulate such video games as God of War, Dante's Inferno, or Shadow of the Colossus. The game takes additional inspiration from the Legend of Zelda game series. In Wings of Lightning, you play as Skoros, a soldier of Daleko desperate to defend his city from a massive siege by Ahdeen, the demi-god of deceit and his armies.  Molina, he demi-goddess of lightning, in love with you and desperate to keep you alive, grants a portion of her divine power to you, hopefully making you strong enough to defeat Ahdeen's armies and free your people. In combat, you divide a deck of poker cards into 2 smaller decks, one containing all the face cards, the other containing all the number cards.  You use the face cards on your turn and the number cards for the enemy turn. On your turn, guess the color (red or black) of the top card of the face card deck and reveal it.  If you guessed the color correctly, add the card to your strike pile.  If you were incorrect, add the card to your maneuver pile.  Continue this process until you decide to stop or until you have cards in your maneuver pile equal to your Speed. The number of cards in your strike pile then determines which combo abilities you can activate, as well as the amount of damage you deal to your enemies.  Your maneuver cards are saved and used during the enemy turn to cancel their hits.  But be careful!  If you gain maneuver cards equal to your Speed, you take an automatic hit from the fastest enemy. The number cards are used during the enemy turn.  For each enemy, draw a card.  If the number on that card is equal to or less than that enemy's Aim, you take damage from that enemy.  You can prevent this damage if you have a maneuver card of the same suit. The contest version is a 78-page gamebook with a very linear storyline.  A post-contest version is in the works that will address some of the problems of the contest version, including weapon balance and replayability.",

Players alternate playing as the Germans, attempting to cement their foothold in Europe, and the Allies, attempting to hold off the German advance. Forces in each European region are indicated by colored cubes on a game board. Melds and runs of cards allow the player to initiate attacks against the opposing forces, while layoffs allow for the buildup of additional troops. Play continues for eight turns (represented by the years 1938 to 1945), or until Germany is defeated on its own soil. The player with the most points wins.",

The White Mage Jasper is quite the famous gardener and his pumpkins always win the blue ribbon at the local faire. His long-time adversary and neighbor, Zot the Necromancer, who is not good at growing living things, has summoned an army of the undead to smash all of Jasper's prize-winning pumpkins. Help Jasper defend his pumpkins by turning Zot's shambling minions into delicate white flowers and then burning them to ash! Game play borrows heavily from classic arcade games such as Space Invaders and Puyo Pop.  The player moves Jasper horizontally along the garden path while casting spells to either transform the approaching zombies into flowers or ignite those flowers and any nearby zombies with magical fire.  The more you destroy with a single spell, the more points you earn.  If you can survive both waves of Zot's undead army, you win the game and earn a score based on how well you did. Jasper and Zot won first place in the one full-sheet label game design contest here on BGG.",

        "description": "In Space Relics, each player is a space pirate racing against the others to get the most items and most valuable artifacts out of an intergalactic museum. The game board has a grid for the platform tiles that players will need to move around in order to reach the fixed gallery tiles where the items and artifacts can be found. The platform and galleries (except for the center gallery tile) are set up randomly each game. Players start the game with 12 action points to use for movement and relocating tiles. However, the action points are reduced by 1 each round to simulate the space suits running out of air and power. Items and artifacts are randomly drawn from two decks of cards. However, the primary artifact, The Heart of Sol, is always in the center of the board. Art by Steve Thomas (www.stevethomasart.com)",

Your family members can be sent to the villages and from there buy their way into the courts by donating money. Money is gained by sending other family members to work in the mines. Will you manage to balance between the two tasks and lead your family to be the most prestigious one in the kingdoms? Your goal is to bring your family members to the courts where you'll earn victory points. You get to the courts from the village councils. The more advanced you are in the council the senior you are and the less it costs to move to the courts. You gain money by moving other members of our family members to the mines, the deeper you go the more money you can get. You also might be lucky to get to the deeper mines. Moving your family members on the board is done by rolling 3 dice. Those 3 dice show to where you can move your family members. As you enter members to villages, courts & mines you advance the other family members that are already there, which means you are helping other players. Only 3 decision each turn, but you must balance between money earning and spending, free family members, position of members in the villages, and when to move to the courts.",

        "description": "CONTROL A FACTION DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES EMERGE VICTORIOUS Skirmish Tactics Apocalypse (STA) is a two player dice-based skirmish-level tabletop game set in a post-apocalyptic near future. There are two ways to play STA: skirmishes and campaigns.  Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions.  Campaigns are a series of skirmishes. In campaigns, players begin with a squad of recruit characters. The game board for STA is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments.  The default game board is a destroyed urban setting.  Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid.  Characters use the grids for movement. STA is a scenario driven game.  Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually a secondary or tertiary objective.  Players win skirmishes in STA by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives. Each character in STA is represented by a token and has a corresponding character card.  During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite status. Players control characters from one of the game\u2019s six factions.  The Combine and Marauders are part of the core game; the other four factions can be integrated seamlessly. Combine: The Combine is the military arm of the government that rules over much of what is left of the world. Echo: Echo is a faction lead by a secretive cabal of humans with psychic powers. Erthen: Erthen are a biologically developed race formed from a mixture of human, mineral, and organic matter. Marauders: The Marauders are a loose-knit band of human rebels who specialize in guerrilla warfare. Order of the New Dawn: The Order of the New Dawn are creatures from the strange subterranean realm known as the Basement. Soldiers of Light: The Soldiers of Light are humans who believe the fall of mankind was brought about due to a dependance on technology.",

Each player takes the role of a group of soldiers who are fighting in a arena for victory. Deathmatch uses only cards and some markers for the characters. The different card types are: - Character Cards: Every character in the game is represented by a Character Card, which contains all necessary information (e.g. Attack-, Defense-Value, Action Points, Portage Capacity and their Special Abilities). Each Character Card has a normal and a wounded side. - Equipment Cards: Equipment Cards represented the different equipment in the game, like a M16, a PSG-1 or a Bulletproof Vest. Characters can be equipped with Equipment Cards, to increase their fight or defense ability. The equipment cards also serve as dice rolls. Each card has a Fate Number printed on it, which is between 0 and 5. In Combat you can play an Equipment Card from your hand to boost your Attack- or Defense-Value and then you always adds the Fate Number from top card of your Equipment Deck to determine the outcome of this action. Equipped Cards are no longer in your Equipment Deck and so their Fate Numbers are no longer in the dice pool. If your characters have good equipment, than the player will have fewer good Fate Numbers in his Deck. So each player has to find the right balance between right equipment and the remaining Fate Numbers in his deck. - Terrain Cards: A Terrain Card represents a part of the arena, where the characters compete against each other.

With an injunction in place to keep the guests from leaving, Moss has only a short window of opportunity to investigate and question the suspects. Can he eliminate the innocent and arrest the culprit before the injunction expires? In this game, you get to play as Inspector Moss, exploring a 25-room house consisting of tiles. Each tile contains either a suspect, evidence that can be used to eliminate suspects, or something to assist you in solving the case in time. On each turn, you roll 7 white dice and 1 colored \"time\" die up to 3 times. You may then use up to 6 of the dice for movement (by matching the number on the destination tile), for gathering evidence (with any 4 consecutive dice), and for getting assistance (with any 3 matching dice). After performing any actions, you must move the time marker down a number of spaces equal to the number shown on the time die plus 1 minute for every wild 6 that was used for an action. There are 10 possible suspects in the game. Once you have collected enough evidence to eliminate 9 of them, you must arrest the remaining suspect and escort him/her to the waiting police car. If you can do all of this before time runs out, you win the game.",

        "description": "INCURSION is set in the world of Secrets of the Third Reich and is the ultimate combination of board game and miniatures game. Armored troopers of the US \u201cLucky Seventh\u201d and stalwart commandos of the United Kingdom\u2019s MI-13 hurtle through underground bunkers and combat the monstrous forces of the German SWD in a furious race against time. The Doomsday Device is ticking and neither the Allies nor the Axis can fail. This two player game features a tight storyline campaign that culminates in an epic and desperate climax. The game mechanics are simple to grasp allowing players to instantly focus on their tactical options. Game play is incredibly fast-paced and tense and players choose their forces through a card-based Requisition Point system. The game is played on a board with a special card deck and highly detailed 30mm metal miniatures. You can also use the miniatures in games of Secrets of the Third Reich. Rules can be found for them here. In 1946, after stunning German victories on both fronts largely attributed to Vergeltungswaffe 4, a compound that kills painfully and resurrects corpses as dangerous animate objects, Franco joined the Axis. Spanish forces backed by Brandenburger commandos and Fallschirmjager Drop Armor assaulted the British held rock of Gibraltar. Germany claimed the ancient fort with its network of caves and aggressively expanded it into a vast underground research, command, and control center, plumbing the depths of the Rock. In 1949, allied forces mount a massive offensive to retake it. The campaign is bloody and hard-fought but ultimately successful. German and Spanish personnel escape by U-boat from underwater chambers. US and British forces enter the German compound only to be beaten back by the horrors that lurk within the vast twisted labyrinth under Gibraltar. Many commanders feel that the only recourse is to seal the caves from the surface, so that is done. Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the lo cation of all of the undersea tunnels. Zombie naval mines damage or destroy numerous smaller vessels and sink the aircraft carrier Lexington as they sally forth from these undersea caves. MI-13 stumbles onto communiqu\u00e9s detailing German SWD plans for a diabolical Doomsday Device under Gibraltar. Given the effectiveness of previous SWD attacks, the credibility of these reports cannot be ignored. The decision is made to clear the caves. MI-13 Commandos and elements of the US Lucky Seventh invade the stronghold in a desperate race to shut down the Doomsday Device before it can be deployed.

In the disease\u2019s early stages, patients present with high fever, vomiting, and weakness. Quickly, the Spanish Flu theory comes under scrutiny. Patients all report having been attacked. Where the disease spreads violent crime seems to inexplicably rise. As outbreaks skyrocket, several studies conclusively prove the disease in not the dreaded Spanish Flu; it is something much worse. Late stage symptoms are found to include death, reanimation, superhuman strength, and an insatiable craving for human flesh. After precious few years of peace, the nations of the world are returning once more to the trenches, united against a common foe. In Zombies & Zeppelins, 2-4 players lead the forces of humanity against hordes of the undead. Together, players must attempt to clear the numerous infested cities around the world. Should they fail, mankind will be swept away in a tide of the damned. Zombies & Zeppelins is played on a game board depicting a map of the world which has been divided into 25 regions. The game uses a card-driven system to determine both the spread of the undead and humanity's military capacity. Player's must carefully manage their meager resources in combating the undead. Through clever maneuvering of their infantry, armor and artillery, and a little bit of luck, players might just be able to avert Armageddon.",

In Space Infantry you control a team of 4/8 soldiers on a series of missions that can be played individually or as a campaign. Each mission takes about 20 minutes to be completed. SI is a modular game; the overall structure of SI will make it possible to easily add new features to the game (missions, enemies, equipment): this means that in the future additional components will add new options to the existing missions, increasing the lifetime of SI. SI started as a free game, and has now been published by Lock'n Load games - go to http://locknloadgame.com/ for more details Game Includes: Rulebook 4 Mission Maps (double-sided) 12 Hive Sector Tiles 18 Unit Cards 4 Enemy Sheets/Time Tracks (double-sided) 2 Squad Rosters 2 Campaign Logs 158 Die-cut Counters",

This duck was very sad because he wanted to give his sweetheart a special gift, but didn't know what would please her. One night, when the moon was full, the frogs that shared his pond decided to help him by gathering a beautiful bouquet of water lily blossoms (the rare and beautiful lotus flowers) for him to give his beloved. The frogs divided into teams of 3, and hopped frantically from lily pad to lily pad, each team trying to gather the most beautiful lotus blossom bouquet. Relive this loony leap-frog race and lead your team to victory by aiding your opponents' frogs - who can't help but do the same for you. Well, let's hope so, anyway! Originally published 1996 as Flower of the Lotus at The Game Cabinet website. At Essen 2003 published under the titles China Moon and Lotusblume by Eurogames / Descartes Deutschland. Republished in 2008 in Klutz's book of the The 15 Greatest Board Games in the World .",

It requires at least two players to play and can be played easily by four to six players. One player takes on the role of the BrickMaster. His job is to create, using construction blocks, a variety of dungeon rooms in which the game will take place, and creatures to inhabit them. Ideally these rooms will be modular so they can be added to the table one at a time as players enter them or get sight of them. The remaining players will play heroic characters who enter the dungeon in pursuit of gold and glory. Since BrickQuest is a boardgame, it uses a higher level of abstraction than roleplaying games. Rather than trying to capture all the nuances of fantasy combat, it uses simplified rules for quick and balanced play.",

All opponents pieces adjacent to the new destination space are captured (playing a move which captures the most pieces is mandatory). The player must then drop an opponent's piece (of the color which is not the one of the space he just landed on) on the board on any space he wants.

Paper is OK, but 110lb cardstock is better. Surprisingly, once folded and glued, the dice have a fair bit of weight to them - not enough to put someone's eye out, but enough for the game to be playable.

        "description": "Mine-Shaft Gap simulates a battle for resources on, above, and under the surface of a lifeless but treacherous planetoid. Players must seek out valuable metals and fuel materials and mine them, using the materials to feed their home planets, and inch closer to victory, while at the same time allocating resources to maintain or strengthen their armed forces and fortifications. Drill tanks tunnel beneath the surface of the planet while drilling stations pound away from above. Drilling stations are faster and more efficient, but are vulnerable to attack from above and even capture by enemy troops. But tunnels can cave in\u2026 And market forces are unpredictable. The resource making your planet rich today might be better off greasing the treads of your tanks tomorrow! The game takes place on two maps \u2013 one representing ground level and above, the other representing underground terrain. The rules differ slightly depending upon the map on which action occurs. At the beginning of the game, the subterranean map is unmarked: it is solid. As the game progresses, units will drill beneath the surface of the planet, creating tunnels through which they and other units can explore the sub-surface, mining for riches and engaging each other in combat. Each map parallels the other, in that each hex on one map represents the same coordinates, just at a radically different elevation (above or below ground) on the other map. Maps are labeled in columns and rows so that it is possible to find corresponding hexes quickly. Hex B4 on the surface map is considered to be directly above hex B4 on the subterranean map, and so on. It is recommended that a new subterranean map be printed out for each game, so that it can be marked throughout the game and discarded at the end. Counters represent mobile units such as drill tanks, transport vehicles, hovertanks, missile launchers, atmo-craft, and squads of infantry with jump-jet powered armour; structures such as command posts and drilling stations; extracted resources; and rubble. They are printed with varying information. Resource counters show the type and quantity of resource with a letter and number. Units are printed with a movement type, attack strength, range, defense strength, and movement points.

        "description": "1000 Blank White Cards is a public domain card game, which allows the players to make the cards during the course of the game. Before play, players seed the deck with their own invented cards. These cards are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. Basically, the game follows \"Draw 1, Play 1\".  Most cards have a point value of +1000 to -1000, and players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. If a player draws one of the blank cards during the course of play, they may craft a new card out of it, often countering other cards which have already been played. Cards usually have a title, a picture, with a score and/or rule. Usually the picture, being a quick sketch by a non-artist, comes out as a stick figure. That's okay. This adds to the humor value, especially when another player makes a \"Stick-Figure Genocide\" card. Cards can represent anything the designer wants to feature, from serious to absurd. (However, usually cards tend toward the latter.) The game ends and points are tabulated after the deck is exhausted, and the winner is the player with the most points. Then, players lay out all of the cards face-up for the \"epilogue,\" which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game. Similar to: Dvorak",

Taking the \"virtual board game\" concept to the bleeding edge; instead of forcing overpriced lead miniatures on players Wormhole offers a complete fleet of high quality 3-D models that you print and build from your home printer. This feature alone gives players the opportunity to build massive fleets without breaking the bank. Wormhole promises \"cinematic\" space combat with visual style and presentation not yet seen in the genre. Rules are easy to understand but offer a scaling level of depth for a variety of play styles. Wormhole also introduces an interactive damage and orders system which removes heavy book-keeping tasks and replaces it with a \"control panel-like\" interface (you feel absolutely in control, barking orders to your fleet). A number of unique gaming elements conspire to make Wormhole a truly immersive and completely original gaming experience. Home Page: http://www.worldworksgames.com/wormhole.html",

The game follows the progress of an imaginary dungeon from the dawn of time through to an arch villain attempting to conquer the world. The creation of the dungeon is driven by random tables and procedures as monsters, adventurers, civilizations, and arch villains interact in an underground environment. The player records these interactions, maintains the dungeon map, and makes some choices in how they play out. The end product of the game is a complete unique dungeon map and history which stands as an interesting artifact on its own or can be used as the basis of a dungeon crawl role-playing game campaign.

The player is the ruler of a single solar system.  There are ten other systems available to conquer and each system has its resistance to conquest and can provide resources to your expanding Empire.  Resources are used to enhance your military and research new technologies.  However, creating a vast interstellar Empire is not without its challenges; events such as revolts and invasions can pose obstacles to your rule.

Pick a side, either Axis or Allies, and build a deck of 40 cards out of a pool of 100 different cards in order to defeat your enemey. The deck or Supply contains Factories, Units, Events and Terrain Modifiers. Factories are needed to build Units and Terrain Modifiers as well as to power Events. Units and Events, which usually belong to one or more of the four factions (Germans, Japanese, Americans and Soviets) are used to attack and deal damage to the opponent, have certain beneficial effects on the game or are used to weaken the opponent. For each point of damage a Player receives through Units and Events, he or she puts one card from his or her Supply (deck) onto his or her Junkyard (discard-pile). Is a player unable to draw a card from the Supply, he or she loses immediately. This game started out as a retheme of my fantasy card game Elemental Clash and ended up being so much more... Very special thanks to my historic advisor Bruno Abreu!!",

        "description": "Deck Delver is a solitaire dungeon crawler type that plays with a small deck. A portion of the cards are dealt face down in a variety of layouts such as \"the Pyramid solitaire game\", and then players will have a hand of 5 cards which will act as their inventory of potions and other items. To explore, simply uncover a card that is free. If it is a monster, you need to fight it by playing a card from your hand, adding the bonus to beat at least 2 of its 3 stats. Once a monster beaten, it goes to your discard pile which in turn increases your inventory like a deck building game. On the other hand, if you miss then you remove cards from the top of your deck. If your deck runs out its game over. The goal of the game is to reach the dungeon's boss and beat it to reclaim an artifact to become stronger for your next dungeon. In the rule book is included 8 different layouts you can set up the game. Full color heavy ink version may be found in the link section since the file is too large to upload. If you Like this game please consider to vote for it for http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1002891/2013-solitaire-print-and-play-contest After the contest there will be updated rules which will change many things and increase the difficulty of the game",

Usually these territorial skirmishes led to a lot of ill-mannered screeching, which was very impressive but rarely decisive. All of this changed when one enterprising monkey learned that a pulled-back tree branch could launch a breadfruit some distance through the forest. This discovery set off a chain reaction of intensified development into offensive and defensive forest technologies. The monkeys quickly learned that catapults worked better than pulled-back tree branches. Research into fortifications became necessary, as a means of defense against the constant rain of deadly breadfruit launched from catapults. All monkeys were issued saws in order to aid them in procuring the raw materials necessary for the war effort. Today, as the sun rises over the Great Wood, a feeling of determination accompanies it. All the monkeys feel certain that when the sun sets in the evening, the ultimate ruler of the trees will have been determined, once and for all...",

The winner will be the Empire with more population and prestige at the end of the game. With a growing empire, feeding your people is the main goal. Wheat was scarce in Greece, so both players must secure other goods supply and the route to five markets in order to trade them for wheat. Each territory may give you different amount of wood, metal, wine, olive oil, silver and some wheat; these two last ones are hard to get but precious. It\u2019s up to you if you want to get more of only one good or less from several of them. Every turn you get goods from a territory you must have some population there (supporting your Empire) but in the end they also have to be fed. Fighting for the control of the territories and the sieges of the polis will be the job of your hoplites, your triremes will struggle to secure the routes to Egypt, Persia...so you can trade with them when the price is low, and a good use of your Diplomatic may convince a Polis to join your League easily. A Polis may be your ally, but they are very proud of their independence, so you will have to create some Projects (statues, temples, artists, philosophers, games...) in order to gain Prestige which is needed for all your military manoeuvres.",

Two players struggle to control the outcome of Project Mayhem tasks by controlling the members of the project (also known as space monkeys). Jack and Tyler can use their actions to play cards (such as Homework, Cigarette Burns, House on Paper Street, or Ikea Nesting Instinct), recruit space monkeys, assign them to various tasks, or bid for control over the Jack/Tyler pawn. Whoever has the most space monkeys on a task when it is triggered collects victory points and the first one to have 10 points wins the game! It's time to learn who's in control! You can get the files here: Fight Club: Project Mayhem available! or print the game on Artscow: If you don't like cutting your fingers - Fight Club available on Artscow!",

Sparta is in danger and its troops are already fighting another battle. You are a Hero and you must save your city. How ? First enroll the bravest men of the city and then go to Athena's Temple. There you'll be given the White Sword, a lengendary weapon to give heart to your troops while there are so few of you and the enemy is so numerous. Try to get some Favors from the Gods. Eventually leave the city to the Black Mountains, and find a place called \u00ab\u00a0The Throne\u00a0\u00bb. That is the lair where the Persians are hiding. And now the hardest is to come: defeat the enemy! 10,000 in my Pocket is played with Event cards on an easy-to-make modular board, ensuring you that all the games are different. Will you manage to save your city from the enemy?",

College Basketball Dynasty is a game about recruiting and developing college basketball players, while trying to qualify for the tournament and win a championship.  Each player acts as the head coach of a college basketball team and has 12 years to win as many games, go to as many tournaments and win as many championships as possible.   As the coach, you determine who to recruit (do you want solid season performers or the star who can win in the big game), who to develop, who to start and bench, and what style of team do you want (e.g., a group of 'team players' or bunch of talented 'individuals' who happened to play on the same team).\" Components: 1 Six-Sided Die 1 Rules Book 1 School Rating Chart 1 Coach Record Sheet 14 School Roster Boards 25 Red Chips 150 Blue Chips 168 Player Counters (General Supply)",

        "description": "Hex was invented by the Danish mathematician and poet Piet Hein , who introduced the game in 1942 at the Niels Bohr Institute. The same year Hex appeared in the Danish newspaper Politiken under the name Polygon. Hein introduced the game to the readers on December 26, 1942 and during the following four months gave them a problem each day to begin with - eventually two days a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The solution would always appear in the following column. It was independently invented by mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version. They called their version Hex , and the name stuck. Hex has the simplest rules of almost any game: connect your color edges with a path of tokens of your color. There is also a \"swap rule\" which compensates for the inherent advantage of the first player. There are a number of resources for Hex on the internet, including several real-time servers. If you want to play face-to-face, used Hex sets are occasionally available, and you can also make your own set. A Battlemat with 1\" hexes can be cut into a 15x15 rhombus grid. Standard Go stones also work well for this board.  It is also playable as a pencil-and-paper game, like the 3M Paper Game version.",

The game-play consists of players keeping hands of cards that represent their potential options. Players execute combat moves by playing cards simultaneously. In the midst of combat the psychological heart of the game unfolds; the players must outwit their opponent by looking for tells, bluffing, and knowing their adversary better than he knows himself.

The council of regents sworn to defend his son split into two factions intent upon seizing power for themselves. As the fog lifts from the mountain pass, each faction stands poised for battle. Only the victor will witness the beginning of a new era in the history of Japan. Akebono, the Japanese word meaning both \u201cdaybreak\u201d and \u201cbeginning\u201d, summarizes the tension and anticipation in the Sekigahara mountain pass, scene of the decisive battle of 1600 that would usher in the Edo period of Japanese history. Akebono is a tactical dice driven game in which each player must present multiple flanks to ensure that at least some of the attacking troops will push forward. Units must be moved into a position to attack when their defeat is less likely. In the end, the winner will be the player who best balances his aggressive and defensive tactics on the battlefield.",

        "description": "At last, peace breaks out!  But, obviously, your previous allies will use the breathing space to re-arm, ally themselves with the enemy and invade us!  As the President, it is your sacred duty to beat the other countries to the punch.  The time for decisive action is now! Each player has his own little country map, divided into conceptual areas: political, military, communications, production and population.  Each player also has a production card, 60 people tokens, 6 Action cards, 3 ships, 2 carriers and 1 airplane.  The players share 30 missile markers (power 5, 15 or 30) and 15 Goal cards. The Goal cards represent your secret victory conditions (see below).  People will eventually spread not only over your own areas but the other players' --giving you a say in each player's destiny as will be seen below. Play is in rounds, with each round beginning with a Player Order and Political phase, and then a varying number of player turns. Player Order phase: The order of play is determined by each player's Communications area.  Each player counts his people in that area, and each other player with people in that area either adds, subtracts or stays neutral (his choice).  Largest score goes first during the round and so on. Political phase: Place up to four of your six Action cards (keeping at least one), face down, in front of the other players, in any ratio.  This phase is resolved in sequence by all players.  Next come the individual player turns. Production phase: Each player's production card is progressively filled up with people markers; the level reached indicates what can be produced.  Producing anything, even something way below the current \"fill line\", empties the card (the people go back to the player's Production area). Embarkation phase: People of your colour (up to 10) may be embarked on one of your ships.  Missiles (up to 30 total power) of a controlled colour may be embarked on a carrier or airplane of a controlled colour which happens to be off the missile's shores. Action phase: The player must play one of his Action cards (the ones he kept earlier plus those played on him).  Political clout (people in your Political area) can be used to instead lay a card aside for a later round. These player turns continue until all players pass.  The players then recover their Action cards from the discard pile.  Cards laid aside during the round are put back in the player's hand --so you may end up with a smaller or larger hand than usual.  A player without any people in his Population area, or with less than 5 total people markers on his country (diasporas don't count!) is eliminated. Goal cards indicate either a player to eliminate (you win even if another player is responsible for your target's elimination) or two players to dominate politically or demographically. The Action cards are: Transfer - Transfer up to 5 people of your colour from one area to another, within your country. Disembark - Up to 5 embarked people on one of your ships off another country's shores disembarks into any area. Growth - For each 5 people of one colour in your Population area, add two more.  Enemies also grow if present. Production - Move up to 5 people from your Production area into the production display.  They may be of another colour if their owner agrees. Move - You can move one ship of your colour, or one carrier or airplane of a colour you control by one country.  Ships and carriers move clockwise or counter-clockwise, airplanes move anywhere. Shoot - Fire a missile on board a carrier or airplane of a colour you control onto an area of the country where it currently is.  The missile kills as many people as its power.  The more powerful missiles can spill their effect over into other areas of the target country.  Casualties must be fairly spread between the colours present in the area (if it matters).",

Half of the rabid fans here are already booing you.  It's your job to prove them wrong, or else end up on a midseason bus out of town.  Fortunately you've got a team of hustle players anchored by a few real stars... just the tools you need to deliver a playoff run... and maybe a Superbowl. Call the plays, make the clutch decisions, bluff your opponents with trickery or just run the ball down their throat.  Lead your players to victory. End Zone is a football action card game designed to capture the strategy, drama, and science of american football, and distill it into quick, intuitive, exciting gameplay.  Quick matches take 20-30 minutes.  Double that for a full game. First play any set cards to assign your personnel for the play... then secretly plot your play.  Once revealed the cards physically line up against each other and give you the range of outcomes.  No books of charts.  No funky dice.  No colorcoding necessary.  The modified execution die (1d6) determines the play's final outcome.",

Players take turns placing markers into hex spaces with the ultimate goal of having the fewest number of connected areas on the board and the most markers on the board when the board is completely full. At the beginning of the game, players take three turns placing a marker anywhere on the board, except along an edge or adjacent to any other marker. After this initial phase, player take turns placing markers, but now they must be adjacent to an enemy marker. During the game, players may have the opportunity to capture enemy markers and place one of their markers in the space or save the markers to alter scores at the end of the game. When the entire board is full of markers, players count their total number of markers on the board and deduct their total number of separate disconnected groups from that amount. The player with the highest total wins.",

It is meant to be simple and in no way is comparable to Arkham Horror or Trail of the Brotherhood, but in it's own right is fun and there is a strategy to playing the game.

        "description": "Zombie Solitaire is like regular Klondike solitaire with one big difference: you get to destroy Zombies!!! Components: Zombie Solitaire requires [1] decks of regular playing cards (including a \u201cjoker\u201d) and [4] six-sided dice (\u201cD6\u201d).  You also need either another deck, poker chips, coins, or anything that can represent [10] Zombies!!!: \u2022    [1] 52 card deck for basic game play. \u2022    [1] Joker, which represents you! \u2022    [1] second deck, from which only 10 cards are needed. These cards represent zombies that must be destroyed during the game to protect the survivors. \u2022    [4] six-sided dice, representing a supply of ammunition for your gun Zombie Solitaire can be played using regular playing cards or a specialized \u201cZombie deck\u201d.  When using a regular deck, the cards represent the following: \u2022    Ace: a Safe House \u2022    King: Grandpa \u2013 the only character willing to sacrifice himself for his family \u2022    Queen: Grandma \u2022    Jack: Dad \u2022    10: Mom \u2022    2 thru 9: the children and their friends \u2022    Joker: You, the armed and dangerous hero \u2022    Card from the second deck (logo side only): zombie \u2022    D6 die: ammo box (6 rounds inside) Setup: Zombie Solitaire is set up like regular \u201cKlondike\u201d solitaire with 7 stacks, four collection zones for aces, and a draw pile \u2013 all from a single deck of cards.  In addition, 10 cards from a second deck are set, faced down, in a pile to the right of the 7 stacks. The joker is placed below the zombie pile, with the [4] dice off to the side. \u2022    Draw pile: crowd of survivors from the zombie apocalypse \u2022    7 stacks: temporary shelters to which some of the survivors have fled and others may follow. Cards that are face-down are temporarily hidden from view; when they are turned over, they can be spotted by the zombies \u2022    10-card pile (from second deck): zombie horde \u2022    Collection zones: areas in which safe houses may be established Game Play: The game is played like regular solitaire, with the usual options \u2013 moving cards from stack to stack, turning cards over when they become open, pulling the aces out and setting cards on top of them as appropriate \u2013 until the first card is drawn from the deck. That\u2019s when the zombies finally arrive \u2013 and all bets are off! In Zombie Solitaire, only one survivor card \u2013 the top card of the deck \u2013 is drawn each time. Play the game as normal, but with the following adjustments: \u2022    You do not have to play a survivor card that you have drawn from the draw pile even if you have an available play. It is always your choice whether or not to play a card. \u2022    You cannot play a survivor card on top of a zombie card. \u2022    You cannot move any card (or stack) that is under attack from a zombie and you cannot move any card (or stack) onto a stack that is under attack from a zombie \u2013 until the zombie is destroyed \u2022    You do not come under attack for drawing an ace from the survivor draw pile (or from one of the stacks) and setting it up as a safe house and you do not come under attack for moving a survivor to a safe house. \u2022    You can move a king (and its stack) to an empty space on the board without coming under attack as long as there is no zombie on the king's stack. But if you move a king from the draw pile to the board, it will come under attack . Zombie threat: Individual zombies are not a threat to the survivors. They are endangered only when two zombies attack at the same time. When a second zombie card is added to a temporary shelter stack, the bottom survivor card is removed from the game (where it will contribute no victory points to the player\u2019s total).  The attack will also destroy one of the zombies, whose card is returned to the zombie horde. Victory: The game is over when you no longer have any available moves, no kings to sacrifice and no ammunition.  Count up the number of Safe Houses you established and the number of survivors who made it to a Safe House. You get [1] victory point for each. A perfect score is 52.",

The Starzone target is made up of different zones, and asteroids which litter space.  Which zone you hit determines which action you take: you can repair your spacecraft, activate your shields, add or destroy asteroids on the target, or damage your opponent's spacecraft. A special Zone Shift zone on the target allows you to change which actions can be activated by hitting each zone, adding a tactical element to the game. Your spacecraft has different sectors, and the health of each sector is given by hit points. When one sector is destroyed then your spacecraft is destroyed. The first player to destroy three of their enemy's fleet wins the game. Starzone is a fun and furious game of dexterity and strategy. Outwit your opponent using asteroids and zone-shifts. Find your enemy's weak spot and flick it into outer space!",

        "description": "Eleusis (and later New Eleusis, 1976) is a card game that simulates the scientific method in action.  You need two packs of cards, a table and some paper and pencil to play.  The 4-8 player range works best. One player (\"God\", \"Nature\" or the \"Demiurge\") thinks up a rule (a \"law of nature\") that governs the correct play of the cards.  Usually, the rule only involves the most recently correctly-played card, but it can be more complex. The other players (\"Scientists\") take turns playing cards (\"performing experiments\") and race one another to see who can come up with a good hypothesis about the rule.  The first player to correctly deduce the rule scores big; God also scores based on how long it took for the players to figure the rule out.  God should not choose a rule that is so hard to find out that nobody does, because then he doesn't score. Additionally, a player with an hypothesis can declare himself to be a \"prophet\" who can predict the results of the other player's experiments.  Other players can then try to bring about the overthrow of the prophet by trying to find experiments whose results cannot be predicted (falsification), thus gaining a chance to become prophet themselves. A very simple rule would be \"Alternate between black and red cards\".  A simple but hard to discover rule would be \"Alternate between cards which have closed loops in their number or letter designations (e.g. 4, Q), and cards which don't (e.g. 2, K)\".",

Yes, they're all available, and if you're good enough \u2013 that is, if you progress up through the \"hack\" levels represented by the number on your character's die \u2013 you may even get to play that complicated character part \"Rear-end of Horse\"! In Deadwood Studios USA (originally published as Deadwood ), players wander across the backlot each day, looking for acting jobs. Your actor is a six-sided die, and the number on top represents your status. (These dice are never rolled; they just show your status.) After you take a role in the movie, you can roll a die and try to \"act\", or you can \"rehearse\" to improve your odds. As you work, you'll earn money and fame, and you can trade those things at the casting office for higher status, which brings you the ability to take better-paying roles. At the end of the game, you add up your money, fame, and status points, and the player with the highest score is the best actor at Deadwood Studios!",

If successful, the player with the greater offer receives the value assigned for the property based upon its adjacent property. The person with the most points after three rounds wins and earns the title of Master Entrepreneur. The game consists of 48 total cards. 24 \"Offer Cards\" 24 \"Property Cards\" There are 8 unique Offer Cards marked $10,000, $20,000, up to $80,000.  There are three of each denomination. There are 4 unique Property Cards.  There is a Mansion, a Ranch, a Trailer, and a Cardboard Box.  There are six of each type of Property. In addition to the standard game rules I have include two different variations (Blind Man's version and Blind Man's Bluff version) in the rules that can be played to increase the difficulty of the game.",

        "description": "Players are playing cards from their hands into a 3x3 grid of 9 cards that act as a common game area for all players. Each card has a microbe type represented in the middle and dots at corners. The dots are red, white, or grey. Players score colored markers by placing cards next to each other on the grid in such a way that one or more of the dots on their card line up with similar dots on other cards. For each dot that matches, that player scores a colored scoring marker for the card that their dots matched (not the card they just played). During scoring sessions, scoring markers are converted into point chips depending on the current layout of the 3x3 grid. Once a scorecard is drawn, play immediately pauses and scoring begins. Of the 4 types available, the one that is represented the least among the 9 currently on the 3x3 grid is worth the most. This means that each colored score marker of that type that a player has may be converted into a 2-point chip. The most abundant type represented on the 3x3 grid is worth negative 1 point. All other types are worth 1 point. Players may never have a negative total. If there are 2 or more types that are both the least represented type, they are both worth 2 points, likewise, if there are 2 or more types that are tied for being the most represented type, each of them are then worth negative 1 point. After scoring has completed, play resumes where it left off and the game continues until the next scorecard is drawn or the draw deck is exhausted. Once the draw deck is exhausted the third and final scoring round takes place. Players then total all of their scoring chips. The player with the highest value wins!",

All you need are these rules, a piece of paper (preferably of the graph variety), a pen and a bunch of six sided dice. The dungeon is made up of a grid of squares, 9 squares wide and 10 rows deep. There are additional start and end squares in the middle column. The objective is to move from the Start square up through the levels of the Dungeon and into the End square where the Big Bad Boss Monster lives and to finally defeat it. Failure to defeat the Big Bad Boss Monster means you have lost. Solo Dungeon Bash is a solitaire dungeon crawl. This print-and-play game is available at http://blackdogofdoom.blogspot.com/2010/09/solo-dungeon-bash.html Online version is available at http://is-games.net/en/games/solo-dungeon-bash (free to play)",

During his turn the first player is \u201cattacking\u201d; his opponent is \u201cdefending\u201d. The attack is done as follows: the player rolls the five d6, after which he can re-roll the dice he wants (however, each time he must keep at least one die, so that the attack will be composed at most of five rolls). The goal is to try to damage the opponent, with each \u201c6\u201d being a possible damage. When the attacker has completed his throws, the defender must try to parry: he chooses one of the numbers shown by the dice and throws all the dice that show that number. But beware!: with a single roll now he has to obtain at least one die with a higher number, and he has only one possibility. If he fails, he suffers one damage for each \u201c6\u201d that the attacker has rolled, plus an additional damage. If he succeeds, instead, the attacker suffers as many damages as the difference between the thrown number and the lower among the attack dice. The Roulette is very simple and each game lasts from two to three minutes. Even though, attacker and defender have often strategy doubts. Also a more-than-two player version exists.",

As a punishment he was given a Hairy Toad. The culprit was then really embarrassed cause this creature eats like 4 cows and has strictly no use for a Wizard. In spite of these light hitches, the gatherings were productive. Were invented there, among other things, this game and the famous spell Abracadabra. Abrekodibru is a card game inspired from the traditional Cheat Game. Players are wizards trying to make up some new magic spells. The more players involved, the more the games are fun! This is a game for all ages, but remains strictly reserved to the uninitiated to the magic tricks. Each card has a magic syllable from the famous one 'Abrakadabra'. Players use the cards to compose new incantations, following an order that must be respected otherwise the magic power of the spell is broken. Each time a player makes a mistake the incantation is set aside and the clumsy one is given a 'Hairy Toad' token. The goal is to finish the game with as little Toads as possible in your custody.",

        "description": "Combat in the Lists is a small hand to hand combat game/simulator that incorporates card management and strategy. During the medieval period skilled knights were famous throughout the land and the lords of the realm would hold grand tournaments to demonstrate the skills of each knights in his service.  These tournaments brought together knights from across the realm to fight for glory and honor.  \u201cCombat in the lists\u201d is a game of hand-to-hand combat that pits knight against knight in pitch battle.  These battles were never fought to the death and the weapons used were usually dull or blunted to render an opponent unconscious but sometimes deaths did occur.  It wasn\u2019t uncommon for a battle in the list to last for hours and end only when the last knight was left standing.  It was this lone knight that was honored as the tournament champion. The goal of the tournament was to be the last knight standing inside the list! Some of the objectives and actions within Combat in the lists: 1.  7 possible movement obtions 2.

The game is played as four players move around the board seeking to loot, overpower, and gamble his way out of the starvation of Ireland by gaining enough coin to pay his passage to America.  Players use a combination of die roll for movement and challenge sequences along with various action cards to add that extra bit of strength and strategy.",

The major hook in this game is the coal trains, which run mainly West-East, taking coal from the mountains to the coast, while the passenger trains run the North-South routes. Also interesting is the fact that all railroads operate with just the President's share sold, and open with 5 shares and expand to 10 at the owner's discretion.",

Eventually the competition became all-out war and the Galactic Commerce Commission was created. The Mission of the G.C.C. was to monitor interstellar trade and only allow certified and licensed merchants to operate. The certifications were quickly snapped up and soon only one last certification remained. Only one more merchant would be allowed to continue trade. The race is on to be the one to buy that certification or be driven out of business. Players build a galaxy from a pool of hexagonal tiles and then pick up and deliver goods to various planets and space stations to be the first to reach 1000 credits. Avoid being raided for smuggling and successfully use varying prices for goods to their advantage and become the last licensed space merchant.",

Beware -- there are many hazards on the factory floor, not the least of which are your opponents! You will need more than pure speed as you use your wits to block, push, and zap your opponents (while doing your best to foil their attempts to do the same). As you take damage, it will become more difficult to pilot your robot. But never fear -- it\u2019s your goal to claim victory at all costs! This game seeks to be a slimmed down PnP version of RoboRally , craftable with a small set of sticker dice and playable with 2 players in under 45 minutes. This game was designed by Clinton Herron ( HanClinto ) for the One Full-sheet Label PnP Contest . Want to build it?

While the Austrian Empire was in the throes of a succession crisis and was threatened by other countries, \"Frederick the Great\" (Friedrich II of Prussia) seized the Austrian province of Silesia. When the Austrians did react, they placed an army between Frederick and Prussia. Frederick turned and approached the Austrians in a snow storm. He had to defeat the Austrian army to re-establish his lines of communication. Comment: Battle of Mollwitz is a free beginner-level desktop-published (DTP) game by Chris Salander published by online boardgaming magazine The Boardgaming Life. The game comes in a PDF file comprising rules, map and 24 counters.",

Planet Masters is a dicegame that contains all the excitement from boardgames about planetary control and war. It captures much of the core essence: clash of fleets, embittering politics and empire building. Planet Masters compiles cunning game mechanics into a very compact dicegame. A set of only 4 dice per player is necessary to play. Each player starts with one planet dice to build expand his empire. Players roll planet dice for resources to build weapons (dice) and gain power. This power can be used to conquer planets from other players. Some free planets (dice) are in a common pool called \"Galaxy\". When a player rolls a \"Transporter\" ship icon on his weapon dice, then she/he can capture a fresh planet to add to his empire. First player to reach a preset amount of victory points wins. While playing other boardgames of space conquest can consume hours per game, this express version enables you to play a quick game that only lasts a couple of minutes. Now you can conquer galaxies during lunchtime! Invading planets and building a galactic empire has never been this fast.",

It is named after the year the New York Stock Exchange opened at 40 Wall Street in New York. 1817 differentiates itself from other 18xx games with its sophisticated financial mechanics that simulate the laissez faire capitalism of early America. While all the familiar mechanics of an 18xx game are present, such as placing tiles, purchasing tokens, and running trains, the game is won or lost based on the financial decisions you make. 1817 includes financial mechanics seen in other 18xx games such as mergers, friendly takeovers, and conversions to different share structures. Beyond these basics, 1817 introduces several additional financial mechanics such as short selling, market driven interest rates, hostile takeovers, and corporate liquidations. The most unique is selling stock short. Short selling is the practice of selling stock you don\u2019t own with the intention of buying the stock back at a later date. You hope to profit from a decline in the price of the stock between the sale and the repurchase. Conversely, you will incur a loss if the price of the stock increases before the repurchase. You are also liable for dividends paid while holding the short position.",

You can download the game directly from BGG (below, in the Files Section). You won't need your feet to play, but all elements of the video games are here: chain combos, \"frozen\" and double arrows, step ratings, etc... This game requires lightning reflexes and mental agility, and people with experience in dancing video games tend to play better. Players place cards on some stacks chaining arrows of the same direction. Each time you play a card, the next required card on that stack changes, so you have to rethink constantly what can you play in each place. Some arrows have special rules for an additional twist. It is recommended (but not mandatory) to play with a referee. Original rules are for 2 players only, but a simple variation allows up to 6 players (divided in 2 teams).",

        "description": "Across Four Oceans is a free rules set for use with World War II era miniatures. The base rules are tactical, but there is also an operational game that features secret objectives. The rules can simulate almost any kind of encounter, varying from carrier clashes to convoy battles. There is no tape measuring required. Instead, the players move and fight on a hexagonal map. All ship statistics have been simplified, and the system uses only six-sided dice. All of the rules and navy lists can be found in the files sections. Navy lists include ships, aircraft, bases, and special rules. Operational maps can be downloaded in both the files section and under the web links. Future maps covering the Arctic and Indian Ocean will be available in the future. The following navies are represented in the game: America, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Mexico,  Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. Also, for fun there are navies for the Confederate Sates of America and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.",

Now it's just down to you and a handful of others: The best of the best. If you pass this final test, you'll be sent on an important mission to an outpost outside the solar system! In this test, you will choose a sequence of four concepts, or 'keys'. This specific sequence of keys is your 'cypher'. You and your fellow applicants will be locked in an isolation chamber. Your mission is to use your telepathic abilities to probe the minds of your rivals to uncover the keys to their cyphers while protecting your own cypher from discovery.

But it is easy to design your own track. Main goal of design is speed of play (faster than other games, ref. Formula D) but still with as much simulation as possible. You must set your gearbox (6 gears) prior to race, select tire type and spoiler. On the track your stamina, tire wear, and fuel weight will have an impact on your driving. There are no \"artificial\" rules to the game, only rules reflecting real racing. The name Next Generation is based on a couple of innovative design mechanisms, never seen before. Most significant is the lack of spaces on track to control movement. Instead you gain distance by adding chips, or cubes, or similar to your pool. With no spaces to count, you finish your turn almost instantly. A Print and Play (15 pages) simulation. You find the files here in BoardGameGeek file section. (TBA when core rules have been brushed up. Contact designer for current revision if you want them). Some hardware needed (Dice, cars and cubes/poker chips) Designer: O.Eker",

        "description": "Saturday the 27th, 1964 Is been 14 days since the detective was lost in the Amytiville Asylum and no one knowns anything about his disappearance. The members of the Syndicate trapped him and made him their lab pet. All this time, they try to reform his mind but they do not know that another group of people was watching his moves and knows what he wanted to achieve. On the side of the city this team plans to rescue the detective. A couple days later, the team tries to penetrate the Amytiville Asylum and they achieve it. They found the detective tied on a bed, drugged and they save him from his torture. Thanks to their plan, they managed to take him and transfer them to their hiding. There, the mastermind of the team has a plan. He has built a dangerous device capable of entering the detective's mind. The team agrees that they will try to awake the detective from his Lethargos but they must first come to same state as the detective through the new device and there is a high possibility that they will die from the pressure their minds will suffer. In Lethargos you lead the members of the team trying to find information and awake the detective. You enter to his dream asylum and there you have to face several Ghosts, trapped memories of the detective inside his own mind which try to kill you but occasionally to help you. The Ghosts which own several abilities, are managed by an extra player who takes the role of the detective. Your purpose here is to open the 6 of the 12 Asylum Tiles and then to find the real exit in order to escape. When the last tile is revealed, several walls and one real exit are placed around the tiles and you must find the real one. If one of the team reaches the real exit, then all the team escapes the dream world. In each round the players follow some certain actions: Movement and Search. Each player can move 1 space inside an Asylum Tile and can search the different rooms on that tile by drawing cards. These cards give different abilities which allow to the players to reveal new Asylum Tiles and trap the Ghost. At the end of each player's turn the Detective-Player rolls a special 6-sided die and based on the result he can activate a Ghost and hit a player. The Detective-Player handles an Event Deck and activates such a card for each new revealed Asylum Tile and he also owns the Phobometer. The Phobometer includes several numbers and each time a Ghost hits a Player, the Phobometer is increased. If the Phobo token reaches the last number, then you lose the game. In this game all the players must work together in order to survive and escape the Detective's Dream World. Be prepared to face your worst living nightmare! Fear is your only god!",

Don\u2019t forget to charge up your cannons to shoot down your enemies\u2019 sails. Galeone Galeotto is a game of luck and memory. You first have to try and pick up from the table your four pirate cards with different colors, before forming the ship crew. Pay attention, if you pick up a pirate in a color you already have just put it back on the table... then try and recall where your enemies have put them, one never knows! Once your crew is recruited, the whole staff is completed and you can start firing at the enemies\u2019 galleons. You pick up cannon cards that allow you allow to hit other sails with a given color: the yellow cannon hits a yellow sail, the green cannon a green sail... Yet you have to set the strategy and decide which galleon you want to shoot at. Sail before the wind and... fire! Available as pdf download on the Kidultgames Homepage.",

        "description": "Democracy under Siege is a card-driven strategy game that reproduces the geopolitical conflicts and political struggles that led to the Second World War. The game covers the period spanning from 1933 to 1940 and is designed for two or three players. Each player takes the role of one of the three Ideologies that led the major struggle for power during the time-line covered by the game: Democracy, Nazism and Communism. Democracy under Siege offers an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by more than 110 game-cards: players deal with historical events and political actions in an effort to achieve the political supremacy. Wars are simulated by an abstract combat system that allows players to intervene and influence the outcome of conflicts. The main concepts reproduced in the game are the ideological struggle among the major powers, the race for rearming in order to prepare for WW2 and the building up of a network of diplomatic links with minor nations. These elements concur to the determination of the victory conditions. Game overview: \u2022 Complexity: 5 / 10 \u2022 Game length: about 3 hours \u2022 Number of players: 2-3 \u2022 Time scale: 1 year per turn \u2022 Solitaire suitability: low",

Each gnome/player begins the game with the same hand of twelve \"colour\" cards. During his turn, each player either plays in the bucket one of his card, or passes. The colours in the bucket blend to form other colours: at the end of each round, one of the team may score points if the resulting colour is one of his favourites. An elegant and fun card game created during the event \"Create a Game from Scratch\" (Gradara Ludens 2003) by:  Andrea Angiolino, Roberto Cestaro, Claudio Del Pizzo, Emiliano Liverani, Giovanni Galanti, Silvano Sorrentino.

        "description": "In Blood of Kings, players compete to build the most glorious dynasty in medieval Europe. You start as the ruler of a single kingdom, but over the course of the game kingdoms can change hands, and you may find yourself wearing several crowns - or no crown at all. Your ultimate goal is to gain Glory by enriching the kingdoms you have had the opportunity to rule; when you develop a kingdom\u2019s institutions or increase the size of its domain by conquering new lands, you gain Glory. Accumulate enough Glory and you get to claim an Achievement, which grants all your kingdoms a special bonus or capability. When all Achievements have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most Glory wins. Blood of Kings is a unique blend of warfare, civilization building, and political maneuvering. Each turn you choose the course of action for each of your kingdoms. Will you attempt to expand militarily, or focus on developing institutions to make your kingdoms stronger, more productive, and more culturally advanced? At some point you will have to divert attention and resources away from these projects to root out enemies at court, for your rule is never truly secure - other players are your constant rivals, quietly positioning themselves to claim rights to your throne or thrust your kingdoms into violent rebellion. If you aren\u2019t careful, you can find your crown stripped away and given to another, forcing you into exile to brood and plot your eventual return to power. Blood of Kings is card-driven, but not in the traditional manner. Each kingdom has its own hand of Kingdom cards, each of which denotes a type of action (development, raising troops, taxation, etc.), and each turn its ruler chooses one card to play from those still in hand. It is through these actions that players gain Glory and win the game. However, each player also has a hand of Dynasty cards, which he can use each turn to hinder other kingdoms, improve his political hold on his own kingdoms, or prepare to take political control of rival kingdoms. Therefore, each player must work not only to expand and improve his kingdoms, but to defend his kingdoms against political rivals while positioning himself to take over as many kingdoms as possible. The game is of the free D.I.Y. variety - you will have to print your own components. Playing time is scalable. Since the game ends when all available Achievements have been claimed, you can set up a short game by using only a few Achievements, or create a truly epic game by making all of the Achievements available.",

        "description": "Egyptian Flood , a card game for 2-6 players featuring city building and destroying. Designed and ideas by: Benjamin Sperling (Gurken Games), James Casey, Byron Grimes, Erik Lechak, Craig Somerton, August Larson, Jay LaFountain. Instructions: You need these items to play: 10 Farm cards, 10 Floods, 7 Settlements, 6 Kingdoms, 5 Pyramids, 6 Soldiers, 7 Riches, 4 Anubises, 4 Sandstorms, 5 Harvests. Some kind of coins for gold, different color tokens for each player, and another type of token to represent damage to buildings (solider damage and flood damage). The deck of cards should be shuffled and each player is dealt four cards from the central deck.  Choose one player to go first and have each player chooses his or her color.  All players take 3 gold from the bank. The first player draws one card and plays a card from their hand.  That player does what the card says, then the turn ends and the next player begins their turn. The game ends when no one is able to play any further cards. Winning: Each player earns 1 victory point for each gold they have plus 2 victory points for each pyramid they control.  The highest total wins the game. I hope you enjoy this game.  It was a collaborative effort of the above designers and idea people.",

To win you must manage your zeppelin resources: engine components, your loyal crew, your weapons,and your cache of gold while completing 3 game Scenarios involving buying and selling trade goods, fighting Air Pirates and visiting cities and waystations. If ever 2 kinds of your resources stored in the sections of your zeppelin (Gold, Weapons, Crew, and Engine) fall to zero you have lost the game. During the setup you will create a 4 tile Zeppelin to carry your resources and provide defense against attack. Various captains may be chosen from as well to give you some bonuses during the game. Scenarios are then turned over followed by cards from the action deck. Each action is resolved with a set of numbers contained on the cards. Some cards allow you to visit cities and buy and sell trade goods plus other resources, other cards involve storms which may damage your ship and its cargo, pirates who will attack you in battle and various helpful cards like trading posts and waystations. In this Print and Play game, 4 pages of rules include a player reference sheet to the cards need to be printed along with 56 full color cards. Additional materials required: 1d12, 40 markers in 4 colors (10 markers to a color) and some way to keep track of gold.",

With a limited amount of fuel, you must navigate through the sky while avoiding obstacles like birds, lightning, and planes.  Pick up bonuses of fuel and repair along the way.  Special items like the shield and looking glass may turn up during your journey.  Gusts of wind may blow your balloon in all directions, but avoid the obstacles along the ground at all costs. This print-and-play solo game is free and is small enough to take anywhere.  Setup takes less than 1 minute (depending on how fast you can shuffle the tiles) and each game can be played in 3 minutes or less.",

In a typical WarpQuest game scenario, each player controls a collection of units attempting to reach an objective and be the first to return back to the starting point. The units could be a party of adventuring archaeologists hoping to recover a lost artifact, a squadron of bombers attempting to hit a military target and return home, a band of samurai seeking to vanquish marauding bandits, or a company of mixed creatures seeking to destroy a piece of evil ornamental jewelry that has the nasty habit of trying to control the minds of all free creatures. The scenarios that use the WarpQuest engine will hold the details. A Victorian themed version of the system in presented in the Artifact Core Rules . Warp Quest was an entry in the 2002 Microgame Design Contest. The contest edition included War Over the Reich , Lost Continent of Atlantis , and Mummys Tomb . The following games utilize the WarpQuest system: Alien Queen Brain Beastmaster Quest Constantine Dantes Inferno Depths of the Earth Destroy the Rail Road Bridge Greek Heroes Hidalgo In the Nam Into the Valley of Death The Isle of Dread Jail Break Lost Continent of Atlantis Mummys Tomb Palace of the Silver Princess Pirate Island Quest for the Grail Rabbit Run Score The Shadow of a Dark God Sharpe's Adventures Surviving the Gulag Voyage of Sinbad War Over the Reich Where Eagles Dared",

It has a fantasy theme and the looks of a chessgame. 2 To 4 players compete in an arena where they each control a team consisting of one large Troll and one Dwarf, led by a Sorcerer as coach. During your turn you have three moves to make with your pawns. Try to get your Troll to a Rock (four Rocks are provided in the arena) and let him throw it onto an opposing Sorcerer. This will eliminate that team. By moving your pawns ingeniously around the board, you must take out all other players' Sorcerers. Push other pawns with your Dwarf, levitate Rocks into place with your Sorcerer and throw Rocks around the arena with your Troll. Mind your head!",

Be the first to acheive victory with 15 victory points or be the one with most points when the game ends. The game plays with players having a certain amount a \"plays\" each turn. a player may either play a card from his hand as a resource,an equipement,a spell,a unit in a formation,or has a stone to build a tower on a captured land. once a player has a formation of 3 cards he may capture a land card and gain its bonus. Once a player has a land he may place stones to increase the lands bonus and gain Victory Points. A player may capture a land by having a better formation (poker style a little).",

        "description": "This self published cycling game by Anki Toner from Barcelona contains 4 teams of 4 cyclists, each player controlling a team. Each player also has 4 dice to determine movement. The game board (A2 size) is a 40 field long, 4 line wide oval track. The fields are in 4 different colors. Each cyclist also has a base under it's pawn (in the shape of a cyclist). The shapes are also in 4 different colors, matching the colors on the fields. Two different sets of rules are available so far. The basic rules are made by Anki Toner who also designed this game, the more advanced rules were made by Ludo Nauws from Belgium, in this variant the game is turned into an elimination race on which the last rider on each lap is eliminated. The game can also be downloaded on the internet for free and is license-free. A second version, Pistard 2.0, was made available in February 2009.  Pistard 2.1 was put online in March 2009.

        "description": "Derelicts of Sin: Heresy is the first in a series of games revolving around the Derelicts of Sin and the dark past of the Theocratic Council. Heresy revolves around Kyle Mason, the sole survivor of a terrible act of sabotage.  Hoping to find oxygen before he asphyxiates, Kyle limps his sabotaged ship into a forbidden Cursed Zone called \"the Wreckage.\"  There, he boards one of the Derelicts of Sin, the Heresy, desperate to find the supplies he needs to survive and return home. This solo game seeks to recreate the feel of classic text-based adventures.  The player takes on the role of engineer Kyle Mason.  Oxygen is used as action points to move, open locked doors, restore power, etc.  The player begins on the Airlock tile.  As he or she explores the ship, additional tiles are drawn randomly and added to the ship.  These tiles provide instructions on how to further advance, reveal the items that can be found in the new room, and detail the the puzzle(s), if any, that must be solved in order to win the game. In the current version, a player sheet is used to track the player's physical and mental states (which affect the player's ability to search the ship and perform various actions), as well as the player's oxygen level and inventory.  Another optional version is in development that will use chart tiles and tokens to track these things. As the player explores the ship, he or she will find data cards that gradually reveal the terrible fate of the Heresy and its passengers and crew.  They also provide victory points that are key to obtaining the specific ending a player desires.  Without sufficient victory points, players will lose when they end the game, so it's important to find as many data cards as possible. This game was developed as part of the  Solitaire Print-and-Play Contest at http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/644090/solitaire-print-and-play-contest/page/1 .",

The game can be played by two, three or four players and the size of the hand varies with the number of players. \u2022 Two players get 14 jangles each, with two jangles left over. \u2022 Three players get 9 jangles each, with three jangles left over. \u2022 Four players get 7 jangles each, with two jangles left over. In the case of three left over jangles, one is put away out of the game and not exposed, to leave two jangles in the starter. The starter is the pair of left over jangles. These are turned face up and put side by side to make a square in the middle of the table. Jangles are placed on the table, vertically or horizontally, played out from the starter square. The idea is to build a \u201ccrossword puzzle\u201d grid of repeated color patterns in the rows and columns. Any set of two or more adjacent jangles ending in a row or column is called a group. The jangles must be played so that the bells in each group form a (repeating) pattern. The possible patterns are: \u2022 a single color repeated, example: red, red, red or \u2022 two colors alternating, example: red, blue, red, blue, red, blue or \u2022 three colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow or \u2022 four colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, red, blue, yellow, green or \u2022 or all five colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, purple, red, blue, yellow, green, purple As soon as a group has a repeated color in it, or contains all five colors, the pattern for that group is fixed, and future jangles that extend the group must conform to the established pattern. As the layout grows, it is possible for a row or column to contain two or more groups, separated by spaces. Each jangle must be placed so that it correctly extends two or more groups, but you are not allowed to create a set of four jangles side by side in the layout, touching along their long sides. If a player thinks he cannot play, he exposes his hand. The other players can then (if they wish) point out any plays he might not have seen. In this case the player must play a tile. If more than one possible play is pointed out, the player has the option of picking the one he likes. If no play is pointed out, then the player scores zero and places no jangle. He is not out of the game, but has to wait for his next turn to see if he can then find a play. The game ends one of two ways: 1) When one player places all his jangles. The other players who started after him get to place one more jangle, however. 2) When no player can place a jangle. Scores are counted and added as the jangles are placed. Each bell on a jangle is worth 5 points, The score is the product of the new lengths of all extended groups. If the jangle used to extend the group is a double, then the score is also doubled. All players lose points for the jangles remaining in their hands when the game is ended. Doubles are -5 points and all other jangles are -25 points.",

Game Play Each player alternates in taking turns. During the player\u2019s turn, the player can perform 1 on the following (1) place a piece on the board (2) move a piece already on the board (3) rotate a piece already on the board. (4) flip a piece already on the board The piece rotates with its black square as its axis, and can be rotated any number of right angles. After rotation, its black square must be at the same location. Similarly, if a piece is flipped, its black square must be at the same location. Each piece moves according to its structure. Taking its black square as the center, the piece moves to any of the coloured square.",

As you search for the hidden route to freedom, you must overcome the underworld's hostile inhabitants and dangerously unstable passages. Object: To escape from your underground prison, or be the last one alive. You Need: At least one standard deck of playing cards with Jokers. A single deck will suffice for a 3 player game, but such a game will be extended and bloody! Two decks can be combined for 3 or more players, allowing a quicker and easier multiplayer game. You and your opponent(s) take turns playing cards from your hand, trying to escape the dungeon while making it hard for the other players to escape. There are three basic card types in Dungeon: 1. Passages (the value cards, 2 through 10) represent the tunnels, passages, and rooms you must navigate to escape. 2. Creatures (the picture cards, Jack, Queen & King) represent creatures of the underworld. 3. Aces represent your finely honed adventuring skills. If you escape the Dungeon or all of your opponents are dead, then you win! Download the rules here: http://www.invisible-city.com/play/392/dungeon-update",

Each turn, the player lays two tiles and then draws replacements from the bag. Tiles are double-sided (where each side is the mirror image of the other), so tiles can be flipped as well as rotated. The idea of the game is to score points by completing snakes. The longer the snake, the more points you score (and you can score double points by completing two snakes with one move). Because any tiles played must match existing tiles on the table, it is possible to block opponent's plays as well as setting oneself up for a big score. There is a constant anxiety over whether to complete a snake to secure the points, or extend it in the hope of landing a bigger score later on.",

        "description": "Lost Treasures is a \"Print & Play\" game where each player must hire a party of adventurers to retrieve the treasure from a forgotten dungeon. One player recruits his adventurers from the noble worthy races, the other from the dregs and evil denizens. Unfortunately, due to the rush to try to get to the treasure first, sometimes the parties are not as well equipped as they could be. . . . Adventure Party Recruitment is done via a simple card system, and the Dungeon board is created randomly, using room tiles. Combat, magic, and other actions are resolved by dice. All the pieces required to play (except for the dice) are available from the following website: http://lost-treasures.tripod.com/",

The cards depict different parts of dragons (head, wings, tail, body) in six different colors. Various combos may be played, from \u201cSerpent\u201d (just a head and a tail, for one point) to \u201cGold Dragon\u201d (all four pieces in gold, ten points) or \u201cHydra\u201d (six heads and one body, twelve points.) When a dragon is played, extra points may be scored for treasure cards in the player\u2019s hand (Gold, Gems, Dragon Eggs, or a Maiden.) The player who plays the combination worth the most points wins the hand. A free card game where players use the cards, which represent parts of a dragon (i.e., head, body, wings, tail), to make combinations (similar to Rummy or Poker games). There are also special cards representing Treaures, Gems, Maidens and Dragon Eggs (which are wild cards).  The game is free to print and play from the Ludi Popina web site and the designer's own web site.",

        "description": "ISLAND OF D : THE DUNGEON OF D A FREE ONE player dungeon-crawling-fun card Game No bookkeeping, NO DICE, just you, the cards, a token and a dungeon to explore! 1. INTRODUCTION With the hero's success in destroying the Black Knight's plan in Dawn, it took longer for him to organise his minions. But the time has come at last, the Great War has begun! Backed up by a very strong Dark Magic, he commands a huge army of Greenskins including the fierce  Goblorcs, unnatural Beasts, and now the Ice Monsters and even the Undeads have joined his army. The worst part is the Light Sword's new power -- the Black Knight now can heal his minions around him, including himself, in seconds! Approaching from the west , in a very short time three castles have fallen to his hands, and his armies are swiftly heading to the capital of D. Once again everything seems hopeless and the King of D has called the 18 legendary heroes to gather in the Dungeon of D, deep in the Forest of D to the south, where legend says that centuries ago the Great Wizard of D hid the Amulet of D'eugor. It is believed that only the legendary Amulet of D'eugor can nullify the Light Sword\u2019s power. Unfortunately, the Black Knight knew about this too, so he placed a very strong magical barrier on the entrance to keep anyone from entering. Luckily, the King has also summoned Daryn and Derek. They can combine their magical abilities to open the barrier for a very short time, allowing just one person to enter the dungeon. But even with their combined power, they can only do this once every three hours. So, one by one the 18 heroes enter the dungeon, hoping to find the Amulet of D'eugor and survive to exit the dungeon. So far no one has returned\u2026 and you are hero number 18, the last person to enter the dungeon. Daryn looks into your eyes before you enter the crack in the barrier. \"Please, you are our last hope\u2026\" You nod a little, then jump in\u2026. 2. THE MISSION Get out of the dungeon alive as rich as you can. And if you are able to, bring the Amulet of D\u2019eugor!!",

In addition, each character possesses a secret power that he can set off at any moment. When a round is over, players find out which of the surviving cabbage, goats or wolves has won.

        "description": "It\u2019s October 1931 in Seattle Washington, and you\u2019ve had a tough couple of years. The Stock Market crash of \u201929 brought on hard times. You lost your job last year when the lumber mill shut down. Nobody\u2019s hiring. The local bank where you kept your money saved made loans to those businesses that were shutting down. Depositors panicked and there was a run. The bank went into receivership, and your savings were wiped out. With no job and no savings you couldn\u2019t make your house payment, and your mortgage was foreclosed on. Like millions of Americans you find yourself jobless, penniless, homeless. Down by the Port, on the site of the old shipyard, some men are gathering supplies for winter: cardboard boxes, tar paper, firewood. You have decided to join their shantytown and to try to start again. Who will eat the most food? Who will wear the least tattered clothes? Who will live in the finest hovel? Who will become The Mayor of Hooverville?",

[NEW! -- this game now includes a FREE special version written for kids and younger teens.] Join us in a thrilling evening of scheming, intrigue and skulduggery. You will be in the middle of the action and it will be up to you to wheel and deal with the other guests. Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive Way out West? It's up to you. It is the spring of 1884. America's west coast is slowly being populated with small towns full of settlers, coming to prospect for precious metals, set up ranches and run dubious saloons. Now the railway is coming! Cactus Gulch is one such small town. Founded 20 years ago, tonight it has a festive air as the townsfolk get set to start their 20th anniversary celebrations. Plus, the railway is coming! However, all is not running smoothly. Land disputes, disreputable card games, strange folk from out of town and hostile Indians are all adding to a tense atmosphere... Way out West lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private. The free introductory pdf file (79 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests, a copy of the Cactus Gulch Gazette - plus details of how to buy the game.

Players capture the high-scoring cards in whist-style tricks, then score various combinations of cards on the table and across the table. First player to 1000 points is the winner.

War in Rio is a politically incorrect wargame based in the traditional Risk . The main rules and mechanics from the classic wargame remain all the same, but the original board is replaced by one depicting the city of Rio de Janeiro. This new board is divided in 42 \"favelas\" - how the slums and shanty towns are called in Brazil -, which are arranged in six different sections, following the geopolitical areas of the city of Rio de Janeiro. In addition, the colored armies now represent the different groups struggling to control the \"wonderful city\". Two colors represent the government forces: black is the \"BOPE\" (Special Police Operations Battalion) and blue is the \"Pol\u00edcia Militar\" (Military Police). Three colors represent the major criminal organizations in Rio: red for \"Comando Vermelho\", green for \"Terceiro Comando\" and yellow for \"Amigos dos Amigos\". The white pieces represent the several other militias \"Mil\u00edcias\" that also play a role in the urban war. Fabio Lopez, the Brazilian designer who created the game, has already informed that he didn't intend to publish the game or even share it for free. His purpose with War in Rio was solely \"to generate a discussion through a shameless invitation to enjoyment.\" However, such an original idea could not be ignored by Brazilian players and several anonymous fans soon joined forces to recreate the map and the cards based in the original photos posted by Lopez in his blog. Given the subversive status of this idea, this game probably will never be officially published.",

Eight or nine different plant species compete for soil and sun, adapting to natural circumstances and to each other, while trying to survive a rampaging herd of grazing animals destroying everything in its path. Players try to give the plant species under their control the right advantages to win the competition with the opponents\u2019 species, and to spread as much as possible. Every turn, after the herd wipes out most of the plants from a small part of the map, the players secretly choose which of their species acquires a new adaptation (or loses one, or spawns onto the map), after which species spread and compete. These adaptations give advantages in specific parts of the map, or in combination with other advantages, or with other species with other advantages, or ... Adaptations are grouped into seven kinds, giving a total of more than 140 thousand different combinations, ranging from poisonous swamp trees, to shade-loving herbs with berries, and many more. There are no dice or other randomization devices in the game (aside from starting order), but the interaction of species with various combinations of adaptations adds a level of complexity that can seem as unpredictable as a die roll.",

So, once someone lays down the first strike, everyone starts attacking everyone in the hopes of regaining their four territories. While laying siege to other lands, you must also defend your own, otherwise the bad people sitting next to you will take them. The bloodshed goes on and on until someone throws down a time stop card, or runs out of cards in their deck. At that point, everyone gets to take a breather and tally up damage. If a rival player pushed one of your territories over the damage threshold, he gets to take your land. It's the original meaning of hostile take-over.",

He put together a team to redesign the city\u2019s main lanes, and he now needs enterprising volunteers to achieve it. And they only got 4 years to do it! Each player will represent the CEO of a Private Mass Transport company, trying to achieve high value for their shares in the stock market, and a healthy bank account. The City needs a new transport grid, either with Bus or Metro Lines. The players will achieve that by building segments of Transport Lines connecting the objectives as dictated by public surveys. Also, the City Hall will come up with special projects, which will be bided by the players. The game turns are split into Quarters (3 months), in which everyone does their actions. After all players had a turn, the Quarter advances, players receive profit (or not!), and the first player of the Quarter changes (so that everyone can have a quarter in which they are the first to build). After all Quarters are done, the Year advances and players tally up their accomplishments that year, which will directly impact their Stock Market EOY results. By the end of the fourth year, the city should be fully networked, and we\u2019ll have a happy Mayor, ready to win the next elections. The player that had the most impact (somehow measured by the value of the shares), will be given the key to the city! That easy? Not really. Not everything goes as planned, strange events occur, people lie, politicians cheat\u2026. At the beginning of every quarter something will happen that can change a smile into a frown. Or the other way around\u2026 And there\u2019s also the Influence that such powerful transport tycoons (the players) will have on politics! Who knows, sometime in four years, you might be the one smiling in front of the cameras holding a golden key to the city! Or you could be the one already planning for revenge\u2026 Either way, fun is coming your way!",

Originally intended to play after dinner, during the tallying of the ballot, to have a funny evening waiting for the definitive results and playing with the possible post-ballot government coalitions... but obviously, you can play it at any other time! Each player has 8 cards with the possible future government coalitions and 12 tokens representing the seats in the Catalan Parliament (allocated according to the polls). In each one of the 8 turns each player must choose a coalition card, and once revealed every player must select three seats (from the party or parties he decides). Summing up the seats chosen by all the players, the coalition with most seats will be the winner of that round.",

The idea is to absorb the opponents pieces into your own by surrounding them with at least 1 more piece value (so a 2 piece stack would be absorbed if surrounded by 2, 2 piece stacks, or a 3 piece stack and a 1 piece stack). When you absorb the pieces, you turn them over to your color and add them to the capturing stacks. The first person to reduce their opponent to 3 pieces or less wins. In developing the game it has become a balanced and subtle game; very simple to learn, but potentially complex in strategy.",

There are special option dice which allow players to acquire more dice to roll and modify the results of their rolls. The game ends after the players jointly have accumulated a certain number of unsuccessful hunts (busts). One major difference in Clovis: the Dice Game' from the original card game is the solo option. In a solo game of Clovis: the Dice Game you are challenged to earn 100 points or more to win. Clovis: the Dice Game' Game is fast (10 - 20 minutes), easy to learn, easy to setup and put away, and best of all... FREE!!",

People came from far and wide to buy memorabilia from their favorite stories.  Some just came to profit from the favorable exchange rate and re-sale of the items. Whatever your purpose is for bidding, use your Fairy Bucks wisely and you just may be living happily ever after.",

        "description": "In the tradition of the popular 'express' family of games, BSG Express is a free, non-profit print 'n play game inspired by the popular Battlestar Galactica from Fantasy Flight Games. It takes the core mechanics, boils them down to their basics, and tosses in dice. The human race is facing extinction. A robotic civilization called the Cylons has destroyed the humans' home planets and is chasing the survivors through space. External threats, however, aren\u2019t the only dangers facing the humans: any one of them might be a Cylon in disguise, attempting to destroy humanity from within. Players will roll their skill dice, attempt to overcome crises, perform actions, and generally accuse one another of being a \"frakkin' toaster\". In the end, either the humans will escape or the Cylons will wipe them out. The real question is: who's on which side? This is an unofficial, unauthorized, non-profit, fan-made game and is in NO WAY associated with Fantasy Flight Games. It is a pure labor of love!

Ship movement is Newtonian and three-dimensional: (X,Y) and (X,Z) position charts are used to track where the ships are at any given time.  Players spend ship points to buy ship components and technology points to buy improved technologies; victory points are earned for destroying pods and ships and for being the last player to have ships in play. When all of one player's ships have been destroyed or warped out, the player with the highest victory point total wins. Four scenarios are suggested with differing allowed technologies and different numbers of starting ship and technology points. The approximate playing time is a guess; it will depend on the chosen scenario. This is Space Capsule #4, the fourth in SPI's series of science fiction microgames.

The focus of the game is on positioning in the peloton, conserving energy and timing the perfect attacks.  When the brave cyclists attack off the front of the peloton, the group may be slow to react but as the kilometres go past, and the breakaway group starts to tire, the chase is on!

The board is simple 11 x 11 square grid. The players are attempting to form the largest formation in each of four different types: - O = a rectangle occupying all exterior spaces of the rectangle (that means there can be a hole or even filled with an friendly or opposing piece) - L = a L shaped formation (horizontal and vertical--not diagonal) with each leg having at least 3 spaces. - I = Any horizontal or vertical line of spaces of at least four spaces long. - X = Any diagonal line of at least four spaces long. Adjacent to the board is scoreboard showing the lowest possible values for each formation: O = 4,6,8,9;  L = 5,6,7,8;  I and X = 4,5,6,7 The player with the largest O, L, I or X, marks its value on the scoreboard.  (If both players have are tied for the largest formation of the same type, both mark their scores on the scoreboard.) The game ends when either one player has an automatic win or they concede no further higher scoring formations can be made.  (The board should be about 2/3 full at this point--there simply won't be room for any higher scoring formations to be placed.) The winner is the first player to form a formation larger than the score board can handle (automatic win), or at the end of game, the player having won more scoring columns than his opponent.  (Ties broken by the player with the furthest advanced scoring marker.)",

        "description": "From Rules: A wise man named Wei Fu had five sons who he loved dearly.  He loved each in his own way, but favored his oldest most of all.  In fact, he showed affection and appreciation to each son in descending order of their birth.  Over time, this greatly displeased his younger sons to the point of confrontation.  Being respectful to their father, the younger two sons did not accuse their father directly, but merely asked the question:  \"What more can I do to earn your respect?\"  At first the father was outraged that his younger sons would question his fidelity, but then he realized their defiance presented an opportunity. His land had been plagued by prankster Dragon that ate his crops, scared away his workers and generally caused chaos throughout his land.  He decided to put his younger sons to the test of ridding his land of this Dragon.  The sons agreed, but pleaded:  \"Should our older brothers be denied this opportunity to prove their devotion to you?\"  Knowing full well his sons' intent, Wei Fu agreed to send all five sons on the quest.  However, his older sons, fearful for their safety, begged for a reprieve.  Acquiescing, Wei Fu decided to ease the burden by declaring:  \"The Dragon is the quest!  However, I would still appreciate any son who brings me the finest examples of the Five Elements of Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal, which provide the very foundation of our world.\"  With this alternative quest, he would assign the easier tasks to his older sons\u2014or so he thought. Weilong or \"Powerful Dragon\" is a simple dice game based loosely on the dice game One-O-Five and the Chinese card game Shou Ba Yi.  Each player represents the role of one of Wei Fu's sons on their quest to collect the Five Elements or capture the Dragon.  Each player rolls their dice and sets aside those dice showing their target number (Element).  The objective is to roll all five dice of the target number before any other player.  Target numbers are determined by drawing cards (Son Cards).   The Son Cards also have unique abilities for the players. Once a player has set aside all five dice of the target number or captured the Dragon (by collecting the dice 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), the remaining players add up the total of the dice they have collected along with the penalty number at the bottom of the card and track those points.  Your goal is have the lowest point total each round and for the game.  The Son cards are then passed to the left and the next round begins (5 Player Game).  The winner is the player who has the least amount of points after 5 rounds.",

By buying levels in your traits and painting the pips of the die according to the rules, you determine the strength and weakness of your character. Even though you roll a pool of up to five dice, usually only the one die with the highest result determines the outcome of your action. By selecting up to three skills from the skill list there are countless of ways to individualize your character - and make him a deadly force on the battlefield.",

The boxed set contains everything you need to wage war in the shadows: including two rulebooks, a colorful multi-part playing area, play markers and movers (metal miniatures are optional but recommended) and a mission timer. Up to 3 players play individual Allied agents while the other takes on the role of Stronghold Commander, with a garrison of troops at his disposal. As an elite Allied agent you must infiltrate the enemy Stronghold, obtain vital intelligence on the Axis secret weapon and escape to report your findings to HQ.  You have two distinct tactical options: raiding (stealthy movement and silent killing) and assault (speed, aggression and liberal use of firepower). Whichever way you decide to tackle your mission, you have just 60 minutes to accomplish it before the Stronghold is locked down \u2013 after which, escape will be impossible. Playing the Stronghold Commander offers a strategic as well as tactical challenge. You take control of the Axis war base, deploy your Sentries to create defensive zones and send out a senior Officer to investigate reports of intruder activity.  When you have identified the threat and located the agents, raise the alarm and mobilise your Guards. Don\u2019t let them leave your Stronghold alive!

Each player starts with a swarm of bees and each bee is carrying a different amount of nectar.  On a round different areas of the hive are made available to fly bees into.  Using a secret bidding mechanic players deploy their bees in the different locations.  The player who brings most nectar to an area claims ownership of that area of the hive. Points are then scored each round for making honey. If a player can claim groups of areas they will score more points. Players can also influence the hive by bidding on cards which give extra points, extra drone bees or more significantly the 'swarming' cards allow players to swap ownership of different areas of the hive. However at the end of a round the player with least points can remove a honey marker from the board and keep things balanced. Beehive was designed to be a quick fun game with a 'stop the leader' ethos in its design.",

Can you guide your candidate through the final weeks of the campaign to the White House? Each week you will allocate each day of the week to one of several actions.  These actions include media appearances, scheduling fundraisers, going on the campaign trail and advertising in regions.  After each action, a roll of the dice simulates the percentage of voters persuaded by your cause.  After each week, your opponent campaigns increasingly in an effort to exploit weaknesses in your campaign strategy.  At the conclusion of the ninth week, the voters go to the polls and any final swings are resolved.  If you get 270 or more Electoral Votes, you have won the game! This is a free game.  The items you need include: - The rules and boards. The instructions are 10 pages long and have several illustrations.  The game board is printed on three letter sized sheets of paper. - Three regular dice (preferrably two different colors). - Use either this token sheet or the following assortment of tokens (about 1 cm or less): - 20 yellow tokens, 7 green tokens, 5 red tokens, 3 black tokens, 8 white tokens and 1 blue token. (12 more tokens are required for 2 players) Source Files: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Byhm3WOEqVA1SnM4Ul9WYXduVjA&usp=sharing",

Will your pack live in legend as the ones who saved the world, or those who betrayed it? Is today a good day to die? Take control of a pack of Garou, savage werewolves, as they battle the forces of the Wyrm in defense of Mother Earth, Gaia. Call upon ancient spirit pacts, mystical abilities, and the tools of the modern world to destroy the forces of corruption that threaton to plunge the world into eternal darkness and decay. But not every Garou agrees how best to save Gaia. Is it best done through force? Through renewing the traditions and spirit pacts of old? Through mystical means? Or should the Garou just adapt to the new age and help Gaia change to fit into the new world? Or sell out and play a pack of Wyrm creatures hell bent on seeing that the Wyrm is the final victor in the coming Apocalypse. But not even the forces of the Wyrm can agree on their methods. Should they concentrate on corrupting humans and Garou to do the Wyrm's bidding? Should they fight the Garou claw to claw? Or should they win the war by destroying every last thing the Garou love and cherish? Gameplay Each player has two decks. One deck is his \"Sept\" hand.  This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat. Play begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile. Play is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases: Redraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards Regeneration - heal characters that have been hurt Resource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc. Umbra - play special umbra cards and actions Moot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players. Combat - resolve any fights. Each round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may: 1) Attack another Alpha 2) Attack a victim 3) Attack an enemy 4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character 5) Attack a territory 6) Do nothing. Combat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers. Renown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.  Renown can also be earned from moots and quests.",

Or will the cops end your reign of terror before it begins? With victims that can fight back, potential news media alerting even more cops to you, and house weapons that can either help or harm you, things won't be as simple as you think. Gameplay: Players will use a deck of cards for the gameboard, and dice and the rules to get things done. Options include cutting lights off in homes, cutting phone lines, trying to fight and kill the victims, as in any slasher film. Of course, when that doesn't go to plan, then you need to decide how to deal with the police, potential survivor types, and other issues.Will you spend a turn rolling to pickup a weapon to help you kill? Or try to rush in and dispatch foes? It's all up to you. This game allows for quite a bit of choice. Also included are Evil Points, which you earn, and can use to pull off the sorts of narrow escapes, and horror movie classics like escaping unscathed from gunfire.

        "description": "From TheGameCrafter.com: Looking for a dice game that has a little more to offer than Yahtzee, but is still accessible by anyone and everyone you know?  Here's a game for you... The goal of the game is to roll six 8-sided dice to get six of a kind in the least amount of rolls as possible.  There are different Occupations that you can take on to make this task a little easier.  Add in an interesting placement/bonus scoring system to further drive the choices you have to make each turn, and you've pretty much got it. Included are some suggested variants, such as a Basic Mode, where you can grab some of your own 6-sided dice and play it without the cards and complexity if you're looking for lighter fare, and also different ways to draft cards and choose roles. A light dice game with a hint of strategy, a great filler or end to a night of brain burners that can accommodate up to 8 players! As of 12-19-09, Quick Six is available here at BoardGameGeek as a Print & Play game!  See the files section below - all the cards are available for printing, or if you're familiar with the game and cards, you can opt for the scoring sheet alone.",

But wait, you found tools enough to fix the car to escape from the hordes of zombies. ARE YOU READY FOR IT? Escape of the Dead is a solo game. In the game you are trying to fix the car while trying to defend yourself against hordes of zombies. You're given 4 Action dice per turn, distribute between 3 sections of the game (either by shooting zombie, fixing the barricade and/or fixing the car). Roll for success on each section. Any zombie that survived will attack the barricade. When you successfully killed 10 zombies you will be rewarded with power-up. You lose when your barricade is down (i.e barricade's hp equals zero). You win when the car is fixed 100% and get out of the house. All you need to play 1 A4 paper to print the board + rule 4 six sided dice a pencil (optional) an eraser (optional) As of 1.5 (The 'portable edition'), all you need to play 1 A4/Letter paper to print the rules 1 A4/Letter cardstock to print the cards/zombies 4 six sided dice 4 transparent card sleeves (optional) 1 Dry Erase Marker/Grease Pencil (optional) Something to erase markings (optional) Gaming Stones (or some other marker) instead of Dry Erase/Grease Pencil. The amount you use is by preference. You will need from 3-30. 12 is ideal (1 for a zombie kill track, 1 for repair track, and 10 for barricade HP - You could make the barricade damage a track and only require 3 markers). You can download the game for FREE in the file/download section below. You can also visit us and play more games at http://experimentalplayground.blogspot.com/",

Principle of the game : The players must go through the different road sections of the special stage made with special cards put on the table at the beginning of the game. They must read the difficulties of the road and adapt their speed and the orientation of the wheel. To change speed and direction of the wheel, players have cards with points. Players will have to drive over the speed limits (but not too much) to win the race. End of the game: The game is finished when someone crosses the finish line. The player with the fewest \"seconds\" chips is the winner. This game received a \"mention sp\u00e9ciale du Jury\" at the 2004 gathering of Boulogne Billancourt for game designers .",

Your publisher is breathing down your neck, so now it's a late-night, caffeine-fueled, rattling-keyboard-pounding race to get the first chapter of your thriller novel Invasive Species finished before he decides to tear up your lucrative contract. Through blind inspiration (drawing cards) and expert cut-and-paste editing (arranging cards on your board), you strive to complete your chapter before it's too late. In the card game Invasive Species , players create a story by using 36 cards that have numbered text showing where each card should go in the story. Each turn, a player draws a card and decides whether he wants to keep it or give it to his opponent. He places any kept cards on his personal board, with the goal of creating an ascending numeral sequence. When the deck runs out, players take turns sliding misplaced cards into their correct positions. The first player to correctly \"write\" his story wins. Invasive Species is based on the novel of the same name by Mike Mayer.",

Well, some of them anyway as you want to get the sheep that you tend home before the other player does. In Hello, Dolly! , each player owns nine sheep which each start the game on one of the 18 mountains that surround the valley. Albert the shepherd starts the game on a green clover space on the path that circles the valley. On a turn, the active player moves one of his sheep in a straight line until it hits either the edge of the board or another sheep; this movement cannot block another sheep from moving on a subsequent turn. The player then moves Albert clockwise on the path as many spaces as the number of spaces moved by the sheep that turn. (For example, if the sheep moved four intersections, then Albert moves four spaces.) If after moving, the triangle where Albert is located has sheep on all three vertices, then Albert collects those sheep, removing them from the board and placing them on the path back to his barn. The player who first gets five of his sheep on the path to the barn wins!",

Then they place new square tiles on the pillars, new pillars on the plates and so on in order to build a pyramid. Each player scores points when he places tiles. The number of points depends on the pillars on which the tile is placed. The more the pyramid rises, the more these tiles make points. Thus each player must try to place a maximum number of tiles and to place them on pillars of his own color. When the pyramid is finished, some penalties are given to the players who let unused pillars on the building site. The foreman who has got the most points gets glory, wealth, women and horses.",

You live your life one jump ahead of the law.

        "description": "The Arian Controversy: A Game of Heresy and Hilarity is a light strategy game for two players.  Set in the early fourth century AD, one player takes on the role of Arius, attempting to gain support for his position that Jesus was not equal to God.  The opposing player takes the role of Alexander, bishop of Alexandria, and attempts to convince the world that Jesus was equal to God.  Players must move quickly around the board, spreading their message across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. On their turn, players draw two cards, each of which has a certain number of action points.  Using one card for action points, players move around the board and lay down support cubes.  The other card is stored away, to be used at the Council of Nicaea. Players debate at the Council of Nicaea with the cards that they've put away in order to gain further support for their position. Once all cards are discarded, the player with the most support wins, and the opposing player is labeled a heretic. The Arian Controversy: A Game of Heresy and Hilarity brings all of the tension and name-calling of early Christian controversy to the comfort of your living room!",

Objective of the game is to be the first to have cards in play that have a total of 10 Victory Points. At the beginning of each turn, a player takes the top card from his own library, and untaps all resources. During each turn, a player may play 1 card face down as a resource. Resources and cards played remain in play.To play a card, pay by tapping the number of resources equal to its cost. Each card's cost is also worth the same amount of Victory Points. Player may activate the abilities on his cards in play. Ability costs must be paid or triggered before the ability is resolved. Costs are usually related to player's own cards. A player is out of the game if he has no cards in his library.",

As a player you're one of them - you must form a team and get as much notoriety as you can by exploring space. You will replicate the space race: from the launch of the first unmanned probes until the arrival of man on the moon. Each of these milestones will give you Exploration Points; whoever gets the most wins the game. Exploration Points are achieved by launching and successfully completing missions into space.  You will need to create all phases of a mission: from building the ship, to the planning of the mission by the ground crew, and subsequent launch. Once launched, your ship will need to get successfully through the mission. You must assess the risks of launching spacecraft prematurely, and also deal with the astronauts and their training. Finally, other players will try to reach the Moon before you because this is the space race!",

Inspired by other Print & Play games on here, I have finally gotten this version tweaked where it is a challenge to play and gain the highest rankings but not impossible. Each turn consists of four phases: Upkeep, Assignment, Actions & Events. You assign dice (the number of which is based on your reputation in the game) to actions each turn. One of which is take over a new location where you bring speakeasy's under your control. When all your actions have been completed you draw an event card and after it is resolved you go back to upkeep and repeat. The game will last 22 turns which is dictated by the Event Deck so no having to keep track of what turn you are on. The cards are formatted to fit Fantasy Flight US Mini Sleeves (yellow).",

Each player starts with 10 cents and a pawn. By moving through the ever-changing board, you attempt to gain more money than your opponents. Each space has an action associated with it, which can change as the game goes on. These actions can gain you cents, cause you to lose cents, change your location on the board, etc. The game ends when all players have passed through one of the three spaces at the end of the board.

        "description": "It fell from the sky and lay buried in ice for 100,000 years. Soon it will be free..... Twelve men: Trapped in the Antarctic Eleven: Discover the intruder Ten: Battle the alien force Nine: Agonise for the answer Eight: Desperate to be saved Seven: Consumed one by one Six... Five... Four... Three... The Thing is an unauthorised non-collectable, non-profit game for two to six players, based on the 1982 horror movie masterpiece \"John Carpenter's The Thing\" , and simulates the paranoid members of an American Antarctic research facility (Outpost 31) being overrun by - or conquering - a parasitic alien organism capable of perfectly imitating its victims. One player begins as the Thing - all the other players start as human. The game is primarily played out using six asymmetrical card decks - three decks for each side (each deck corresponds to a different section of the narrative). Managing your hand of cards, and when to use each deck, is key to winning the game. The twelve members of the Outpost 31 team cards are positioned between the players, with each human player taking one character. The team then have to overcome various encounters, while trying to stay alive, in an effort to stop the Thing. Encounters are directly taken from film events, and are sorted into three separate acts - the second and third acts are shuffled, and then all three acts are placed together, forming one narrative (in this way, each game is a little different). Some example encounters: Autopsy of Norwegian-Thing, Battle in Dogtown, Explore Norwegian Base, Conduct Blood Test , and Investigate Crashed Saucer Site . In addition, the Outpost team must allocate men to tasks that may aid in their victory over the Thing. The truth being that the humans will not be able to achieve all that they want to do and will have to prioritise. All the while, the Thing player will do all in its power to thwart the human players, while attempting to construct its Blair-saucer in a secret ice cavern by cannibalising parts from the bulldozer, radio room, and helicopter. During the game, at various stages, the Thing player has the opportunity to place infection or dummy infection cards under the human character cards. Later in the game, the Thing may even directly infect other players (unbeknownst to the remaining players), or give the impression to the others that it has! The humans must keep their wits about them if they are to fight and win against the Thing, or they may find themselves fighting each other.... Victory Conditions: 1. The Outpost #31 team win if they survive the final confrontation, having destroyed the camp and sabotaged the Thing's Blair-saucer - and have killed all the Things. If they are mistaken and some Things remain: the Things win. If they killed a non-infected player: the Thing wins. 2. The Thing wins if it completes construction of its Blair-saucer. 3. The Thing wins if all the humans have been assimilated or killed. 4. The Outpost #31 team win if the survivors manage to fly to the coast in the helicopter. 5. The Outpost #31 team win if they contact McMurdo base by radio. Please note: This game is strictly for adults - with profanity and horrific imagery on many of the cards.

        "description": "If I tell you Leviathan is a cross between 'Go Fish' and a non-collectible 'Magic: the Gathering', you will instantly know pretty much everything you need to know about this game. Players take turns asking each other for cards matching the ones in their hands, each card being named after a particular fish (or fish-related being, such as Atlantean Priests or Mermaids). When a player manages to get a pair, they place it face-up on the table in front of them, just like in Go Fish. Once the cards hit the table, the Magic: the Gathering aspects come into play, as most of the fish have unique powers that can be used to aid you or annoy your opponents. There are also unique cards (with names like \"Flying Dutchman\" and \"Offshore Oil Rig\"), which have more esoteric powers and move from player to player as they get used. When one player runs out of cards in their hand, everyone scores a point for each pair they possess, and a new hand is dealt until every player has dealt once, at which point the final scores are tallied and a winner is declared. (Game time is thus dependant on number of players -- my guess of 90 minutes is a rough estimate of a 6-player game, which may not be at all accurate.) In many ways, Leviathan epitomizes the \"beer-and-pretzels\" game -- in fact, it was designed in a coffee shop, out of a need for something to do while sitting in a coffee shop. The rules encourage a light (\"jovially rude\") atmosphere, and the writing style generally reflects this, although careful attention has been paid to the way the various cards interact, and to fix any possible contradictions or loopholes. (And the rule set has been edited to remove unnecessary rudeness in the author's writing style, although -- shh! -- an \"impolite\" version of the rules is rumored to exist, somewhere...) Players are encouraged to devise new card powers and game variations, and as a bonus for players south of the equator, a special \"Southern Hemisphere\" option is given, which explains the way the Coriolis Effect changes the order of play.",

        "description": "Blokus Trigon is an abstract strategy game from the makers of Blokus . The board pieces have changed from square to triangular. Game play is similar to Blokus, as players try to get rid of all their pieces. The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one of your pieces already on the board at a corner. There is a solitaire version where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting. Components: Hexagonal playing board with 486 triangles on the board 4 sets of 22 pieces in red, blue, green and yellow 1 piece made up of one triangle. 1 piece made up of two triangles. 1 piece made up of three triangles. 3 pieces made up of four triangles. 4 pieces made up of five triangles. 12 pieces made up of six triangles. Set up: Layout your hexagonal silver board and give each player a set of 22 squares. Game Play: Each player begins at one of the marked spaces on the board. The order of play is blue, yellow, red, green colors. As the play progresses, each new piece is placed on the board. The new piece placed must touch another piece of the same colour and it can only touch at the corners. The constraint is never touch along the sides. When a player is blocked and cannot place any more pieces on the board, they must drop out of the game. The other players continue until they are blocked or no one is able to place any more pieces on the board. Scoring: When all the players are blocked, each player must count the number of triangles that they were unable to place on the trigon board and calculates their score as follows: Any triangle that is not placed on the board counts towards a negative point. 15 points are awarded as a bonus, if  the player has all 22 pieces placed on the board. This bonus increases to a 20 points if the 22 pieces were placed on the board with the single triangle being placed last. The winner is the person with the maximum points!",

There are two phases to the game, placement and move & capture. During placement, each player takes turns placing one piece on the board, unless a capture is available, which immediately takes precedence. Pieces may not be placed such that they force an immediate capture unless there is already a capture threat elsewhere or there is no choice but to place a piece in jeopardy. The last player places all of his/her remaining pieces on the board at once in one tall \"shadow\" piece. Players control stacks when their piece is on top. In the movement & capture phase, players move one piece one square at a time to the next square (only on the black squares -- connectivity is four) or capture (mandatory when possible) the top piece of a stack under the bottom of another stack by jumping over it. Jumps can be repeated, and maximal captures are mandatory. The first player unable to move loses.",

As racing always has been part of mankind's sports culture, there are a couple of themes given on the last sides of the rulebook, so you are free to choose the setting as well as the orientation of the gameplay (tactics, luck, wargame).

        "description": "Dungeon in a Tin is a solo or cooperative dungeon-hack. Players descend into a dungeon randomly laid-out from a stack of tiles, fighting through the orc and goblin hordes to rescue the kidnapped maiden and collect treasure and glory. Each player takes turns to move through the dungeon one tile at a time, laying new tiles as unexplored areas are entered; every time a player enters a room, special monster dice are rolled to determine the enemies faced and the potential loot to be found. When a monster attacks, a die is rolled to determine the style of their attack; the player then chooses a card from his hand to counter with, each card being strong against some kinds of attack and weak against others. The ultimate goal of the game is for the players to fight their way to the bottom of the dungeon to rescue the captured maiden - and then fight their way out with her. The dungeon will become harder to fight through as the player delves deeper, and then harder still on the way out with a helpless rescuee in tow. This Print-and-Play game was an entry in the 'One Full-sheet Label' design contest here on BGG, and as such the printed components fit entirely on a single label sheet. A small number of other tokens and blank dice will also be required. Additionally, as the name hints, once constructed on cardstock it is possible to fit the game inside an Altoids tin or similar.",

In Nine circles of Hell , the first player to pick up and deliver three souls and return to Limbo wins the game. However, Hell is not an easy place to navigate. Portals leading to the nine Circles can be approached from either of two directions, and each approach teleports you to a different place on the board. To complicate things, when a player uses a portal, the portal spins around so that its approaches are now switched. To deliver your souls, you must puzzle out how to use the portals in your favor to get to where you want to go.",

The first player to get to his destination, to find The Way, is the winner. The Way is very simple to play, but deviously so.  Can you be the master of The Way? The object of the game is to get from your Start card to your Midpoint card and back again.  By rotating and replacing cards, you try to open a Way for yourself whilst closing your opponent's.

I'm here, well because I'm a detective and that's what I do - solve mysteries. This one began when a strange note fell into my possession. Now that I'm here, I don't feel as if I'm alone - the voices are back... Are they phantoms of an insane mind or possibly shadowy thoughts of a deranged personality? Maybe they are all entities living within the world of our detective's mind. In Phobos, each player takes on the role of one of these personalities. Your goal is to eliminate the personalities of your opponent(s). Once accomplished then your personality prevails allowing you to control the detective. Each of you chooses a Mentality board, 8 Ghost Miniatures, 12 Character Miniatures, a D12 Die and 3 Action cards. Players then each get 3 Phobos cards (from 12 different possibilities) and keep these face down. These cards represent your Fears and an extension of the Detective who is imprisoned inside the Amityville Asylum. (Note that the Mentality board includes all the 12 different fears matching the 12 Phobos cards.) In each round you play an Action card which will instruct you to place your Miniatures either on your board or your opponent's (depending on the card) trying to find their fears. If you place a Miniature on an opponent's Mentality Board that matches one of their fears, they are forced to reveal that fear. Then, based upon how you placed your Miniature you will have accumulated movement points which will be used to place and move your Ghosts on the main board (comprised of 16 tiles). The board includes four central halls where your Ghosts enter the detective's head and 12 fear rooms which represent each of the Phobos cards. When you place 2 Ghosts in a room which represents one of your Phobos cards, you are protected (for as long as they remain). This then makes it so that when an opponent places a Character Miniature on your Mentality board matching one of your fears, you are not forced to reveal your Phobos Card. It sounds simple but nothing is simple in the dream world where nightmares and demons prevail! On the other hand you can play an Adrenaline card and bring the upside down in the game. But these cards cost one of your Ghost, if you to claim one. If your Fears are revealed by your rivals, then you lose but you are not eliminated. You become a Ghoul that can take revenge on the other Personalities still in play. As a Ghoul you can help control how the game unfolds by playing the right cards and destroying the rival Personalities. You have more advantages like you have more moves or you can even create a modular board. It is time to explore your personality in the ultimate interactive horror game! Fear is your only god!",

It was a finalist in the 2001 8\u00d78 Game Design Competition sponsored by About Board Games, Abstract Games Magazine, and the Strategy Gaming Society. Robo Battle Pigs is a lighthearted programmed movement battle game played on an 8x8 board using 1 token with a distinct front for each player.  Players program a sequence of 5 moves for their Robo Battle Pig(RBP) using pen & paper, then simultaneously execute the program 1 step at a time.  RBPs may move in several directions, fire a laser, swing their snout, rest, or regenerate.  When an RBP is damaged, it loses one programming step.  When 5 points of damage have been received, the RBP is destroyed.  Last pig standing wins.",

        "description": "Taken from the publisher's website: To play PLUG INN , the biggest board game in the world, you need a friend and a big, BIG table. If you don't have a big enough table, fear not! The game board can be easily adapted to the size of your choice... In PLUG INN, players compete in a \"Macro-Game\" by placing their tokens on a board composed of hexagons. Every hex of the game contains a \"micro-game\" that a player must win in order to place a token in the hex. Macro and micro games are controlled by a few general rules. Even if the general rules do not change, it is always possible to pick up a new Macro-Game or add new micro-games to refresh PLUG INN . The first supplied Macro-Game is Hex. In Hex, you need to place several micro-games hexes in order to form a diamond-shaped board. Each player marks two opposite sides of the diamond with his tokens. Afterwards, tokens are played in the hexes according to the rules of PLUG INN . The goal is to connect your opposite sides with an uninterrupted chain of your tokens. The first micro-games are: -Trip, an interesting variant of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe -Kono, a simple game in which you need to capture your opponent's tokens -Bulo, a reduced variant for the classic game of Nim -Decapawn, inspired by Martin Gardner's Hexapawn, where pawns battle on the board much like in Chess This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.",

The players take the roles of some of the important characters from the film (Ash, Henry, etc.) and try to defeat Evil Ash and his horde of Deadites.  The game can be played cooperatively where the evil forces are controlled by predetermined objectives, or instead one of the players can control all of the evil forces.  Game play consists of players searching the castle for allies and equipment they can use to fight the Deadites (flaming arrows, explosives, etc.) and the actual combating of the evil army.  Players win if they defeat the four evil champions.  Evil wins if Evil Ash gets the Book of the Dead out of the castle or if the Deadite army kills all of the players.",

        "description": "BUILD a party of specialized fantasy heroes. CONSTRUCT a battlefield with environment tiles, terrain, and fortifications. DESTROY your opponent(s) with a mix of melee, ranged, and magical attacks. TactDecks: Reign of Heroes is a fully customizable, expandable battle system. A single set supports multiple players, or add additional sets to increase the size of your battlefield and options. Highly portable and adaptable, TactDecks supplies a nearly-infinite combination of battlefield layout and party configurations. Whatever your tactical preference - spell, sword, arrow, subterfuge, or a little bit of everything - TactDecks adapts to your tactical style. There's no arenas. No static mats. Movement is organic and possible in every conceivable direction (including up and down). Climb, move, or demolish terrain, don't just look at it! Mechanics are completely card driven and require players to pay attention not only to the attacks and misses they've drawn, but what other players have drawn as well. TactDecks: Reign of Heroes is the second edition of TactDecks, a revision featuring numerous improvements to the original design. New to the 2nd edition: MULTI-PLAYER support (now play with 2-4 players, or add additional TactDecks sets for up to 8 players and/or expanded army-building options). Play time approximately 20 minutes per player. Completely NEW ART, featuring beautiful, distinctive graphics by Robin Meyer Simple and elegant TILE FORMAT, which allows a battlefield as big or as small as your table allows. Loads of new Heroes... 15 DIFFERENT CLASSES, with 39 playable Heroes in all! Improved RESERVE system: Play your Reserves as out-of-turn interrupts, Heal during the Tactical phase... or chain them all together for a devastating tactical combo! New SHADOW LORD mechanic, allowing for SOLO play or a neutral AI-driven third party that provides additional challenge for competing players. The 2nd Edition of TactDecks incorporates substantial feedback from dedicated fans, playtesters, and reviewers. The system is in final stages of playtesting, with an eye towards Kickstarter funding in 2013 for publication. Re-implements: TactDecks TactDecks version history: TactDecks 2010 (V1) - Two-player card-based tactical minis game, similar in format to Battleground and Summoner Wars. V1's art and graphics were entirely handled by Eric Etkin, and the V1 is easily recognizable by the black background to the cards. TactDecks has its own separate BGG listing. TactDecks 2011 (V2) - Two-player card-based tactical minis game, similar in format to Battleground and Summoner Wars. V2 introduced some limited Quest options and primarily addressed the artistic simplicity of V1. V2's art was handled by Eric Etkin, and the greatly enhanced graphic design was spearheaded by Robin Meyer. TactDecks has its own separate BGG listing. TactDecks: Reign of Heroes (V3) - 1-8 player tactical minis game that utilizes the core V1/V2 mechanics, but changes the format from \"cards as minis\" to a modular tile-based board. Changes to the game are numerous, including format, multi-player scaling, solo play options, and a greatly augmented power-up component (Artifacts) which can dramatically change the strategies each game you play.",

Will you land your carefully planned punches on target? Will you be able to block your opponent\u2019s punches? Will you be able to out bluff your rival? Can you knock him or her out before the end of the match? You will soon find out in this fast and fun game of boxing. Description and Aim of the Game Each match consists of three rounds. In each round ten cards are played. In between rounds there are breaks that allow the boxers to rest and regain some stamina.

        "description": "ZOMBIES AT THE DOOR \u201cZombies at the door\u201d is a zombie apocalypse card/table-top game for one to two players. ZATD is a CARD ONLY GAME with no dice yet you will use your cards as playing elements on the game table for movement, searching, and attacks. Players take turns searching throughout their neighborhood for survivors, supplies, and weapons then try to make it back to their safe house alive; all the while zombies are everywhere trying to eat them. Goal:  Search [4] houses in the neighborhood and find as many survivors as possible.  Along the way you will fight or flee from zombies at every corner; they will be scattered throughout the neighborhood, inside homes and they\u2019re constantly multiplying.  You will search for supplies and weapons to help you along the way and rescue survivors who need your help to stay alive. Once a house is reached, it must be search room-by-room but watch out a zombie could be lurking behind any door!  After all rooms have been searched gather any survivors and head outside but be careful; zombies could be waiting for you. Always remember that your opponent is out there ready to sabotage your progress, draw zombies to your location, pick up supplies that you\u2019ve dropped, and rescue survivors you\u2019ve left behind. Winning conditions: The first player to search and clear [4] houses and return back to his own Safe House with the most survivors alive wins OR if both players have turned into zombies the one with the most survivors inside his Safe House wins. Losing conditions:  Unfortunately there is no hope for anyone who dies in Zombies at the door.  With unknown virus spreading throughout the world everyone has been infected and once you die you turn into the living dead.  So, lose your life points and it\u2019s off to the zombie brotherhood for you!  Once you become a zombie, you now control a special zombie player card and try to attack and eat your fellow player!  You are also in control of all the zombie movements and attacks until the other player wins or is turned into a zombie, which ends the game. ALL FILES CAN BE FOUND IN THE WEBLINKS SECTION!!!!",

On your birthday you got a brand new metal detector and a shovel from a buddy of yours who is totally into this rather weird hobby. So you and up to three of your friends take to the fields in search of treasures. What will you find? Trash or Treasure?? In this free to print and play board game for two to four players, you grab your Beginner's Detector and a Small Shovel and search a field for hidden treasures like coins, rings and artefacts. But beware, there is not only treasure to be unearthed, but also useless trash. For each treasure you add to your collection, you score one Victory Point. You may sell off Treasure from your Collection to buy new equipment, like better detectors and shovels. For every two pieces of Trash in your Garbage Bin, your VP Score is reduced by one. Whoever reaches 10 Victory Points first is the winner (in a 2 players game - if there are 3 players, you need 7 VPs to win, if there are 4 players, you need only 5 VPs). The other players may continue to play for second and third places.",

Hopefully when he eventually catches Koko, he will be able to get several pairs of underwear back simultaneously. Anyway he\u2019ll have to make sure that at 5 o\u2019clock, no more guest still has a piece of underwear in hand or he loses his job.",

Each player holds a hand of ten cards at the beginning of each round, and each player contributes card(s) to the \"card czar\" anonymously.  The card czar determines which card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an \"Awesome Point.\" In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are \"Pick 2\" or  cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may pay in an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points. After each round, the role of card czar rotates around the table, and play continues until everyone decides to stop.

This expansion uses the same playing board, buildings, military units and dice but introduces a deadly new monster with new Monster Hit cards. Concept and Objective A huge multi-tentacled monster is attacking your city. From below! Mobilize your troops and exterminate the beast before every building becomes a heap of rubble. The victorious task force will score more hits and rescue more survivors than their opponent. Game Overview Two players compete to rescue survivors and win the most \u2018Monster Hit\u2019 cards. The \u2018Monster Die\u2019 generates random actions for the Monster making the beast unpredictable and dangerous. It destroys everything in its path, moving effortlessly around the city on a tangle of amorphous tentacles. As it moves, the monster pushes tentacles into the ground, creating a network of tunnels beneath the city. Tentacles burst up through the ground grabbing tanks and helicopters and crushing whole buildings. Taking turns to move their Tank and/or Helicopter Units, players get into position to attack the Monster and its tentacles. Win \u2018Monster Hit\u2019 cards by successfully firing at the Monster or tentacles and fulfilling the conditions on the cards. Act fast, If the city is flattened before the Monster is killed, the Monster wins!",

        "description": "Glider-Pit Gladiators is a board game of ancient aerial combat. The latest version (2002) is currently available for download from the BoardGameGeek files section below. Two to six players control primitive gliders descending into a deep, sheer-walled pit. Within this natural arena the glider pilots engage in ritualistic gladiatorial combat. A combination of martial and flying skills is required for victory. Every decision a player makes, from the selection of weapons to the anticipation of fickle air currents, helps determine whether a gladiator is on the road to glory... or disaster. The object of the game is simply to have the last glider airborne. The game features a variable player turn order (depending on the altitude and speed of each glider), five different types of weapons (including ranged weapons and nets), risky ramming attacks, and up/down drafts. Players have the option of controlling more than one glider (up to three each in a two-player game). The competition may be a \"last man flying\" free-for-all or the players can form competing teams of gliders. The experimental Campaign Expansion rules allow you to play a continuing gladiator character. The Expansion includes rules for Character Survival, Experience, and Special Abilities and Advantages. Gladiator characters who survive a match (and aren't crippled in the process) receive experience and a chance to gain special abilities and advantages. Gladiators who are victorious are more likely develop skills that will help them gain future victories in the arena. A procedure for randomly generating experienced gladiator characters is also described. Glider-Pit Gladiators was originally designed (under a deadline of a month or two) for the online 1998 Microgame Design Contest held via the Yahoo Groups Microgame Mailing List. The game was updated under the name Glider-Pit Gladiators 2002 for the second micro-game design competition. The 2002 update focused on cleaning up the rules and making improvements to the spartan components. The experimental Campaign Expansion Rules were developed to provide added depth, and they were also updated in 2002.",
